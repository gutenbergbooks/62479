  <h2 class='c005'>IN APPRECIATION OF WILLIAM F. CODY<br /> <span class='small'>(BUFFALO BILL).</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is now some generations since Josh Billings, Ned
Buntline, and Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, intimate friends
of Colonel William F. Cody, used to forgather in the
office of Francis S. Smith, then proprietor of the <cite>New
York Weekly</cite>. It was a dingy little office on Rose Street,
New York, but the breath of the great outdoors stirred
there when these old-timers got together. As a result of
these conversations, Colonel Ingraham and Ned Buntline
began to write of the adventures of Buffalo Bill
for Street &amp; Smith.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Cody was born in Scott County, Iowa, February
26, 1846. Before he had reached his teens, his
father, Isaac Cody, with his mother and two sisters,
migrated to Kansas, which at that time was little more
than a wilderness.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the elder Cody was killed shortly afterward in
the Kansas “Border War,” young Bill assumed the difficult
rôle of family breadwinner. During 1860, and until
the outbreak of the Civil War, Cody lived the arduous
life of a pony-express rider. Cody volunteered his services
as government scout and guide and served throughout
the Civil War with Generals McNeil and A. J.
Smith. He was a distinguished member of the Seventh
Kansas Cavalry.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the Civil War, while riding through the streets
of St. Louis, Cody rescued a frightened schoolgirl from
a band of annoyers. In true romantic style, Cody and
Louisa Federci, the girl, were married March 6, 1866.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1867 Cody was employed to furnish a specified
amount of buffalo meat to the construction men at work
on the Kansas Pacific Railroad. It was in this period
that he received the sobriquet “Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1868 and for four years thereafter Colonel Cody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>served as scout and guide in campaigns against the Sioux
and Cheyenne Indians. It was General Sheridan who
conferred on Cody the honor of chief of scouts of the
command.</p>

<p class='c007'>After completing a period of service in the Nebraska
legislature, Cody joined the Fifth Cavalry in 1876, and
was again appointed chief of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Cody’s fame had reached the East long before,
and a great many New Yorkers went out to see
him and join in his buffalo hunts, including such men
as August Belmont, James Gordon Bennett, Anson
Stager, and J. G. Heckscher. In entertaining these
visitors at Fort McPherson, Cody was accustomed to
arrange Wild-West exhibitions. In return his friends
invited him to visit New York. It was upon seeing his
first play in the metropolis that Cody conceived the idea
of going into the show business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assisted by Ned Buntline, novelist, and Colonel Ingraham,
he started his “Wild West” show, which later
developed and expanded into “A Congress of the Roughriders
of the World,” first presented at Omaha, Nebraska.
In time it became a familiar yearly entertainment
in the great cities of this country and Europe.
Many famous personages attended the performances, and
became his warm friends, including Mr. Gladstone, the
Marquis of Lorne, King Edward, Queen Victoria, and
the Prince of Wales, now King of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the outbreak of the Sioux, in 1890 and 1891,
Colonel Cody served at the head of the Nebraska National
Guard. In 1895 Cody took up the development
of Wyoming Valley by introducing irrigation. Not long
afterward he became judge advocate general of the
Wyoming National Guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill) died in Denver, Colorado,
on January 10, 1917. His legacy to a grateful world was
a large share in the development of the West, and a
multitude of achievements in horsemanship, marksmanship,
and endurance that will live for ages. His life
will continue to be a leading example of the manliness,
courage, and devotion to duty that belonged to a picturesque
phase of American life now passed, like the great
patriot whose career it typified, into the Great Beyond.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>IN A TIGHT PLACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One June night in the early seventies, the sole occupant
of a lonely cabin high up in the Rockies had a
bad dream. Pursued by a legion of monsters, he found
himself on the verge of a bottomless pit. While he
choked with terror, a terrific noise as of the bursting
of a bomb dissipated the horrible illusion to which his
brain had been subjected, and he awoke gasping and
wild-eyed. His face was covered with a cold perspiration,
and for some moments he was incapable of movement.
With the return of his wits came sounds that
he could distinguish. They brought him to his feet
instantly. Not far away had come a succession of
pistol and rifle shots.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he hurriedly dressed, a bright light streamed in
at the window. The room was brilliantly lighted up,
and the man could hear the crackling of timbers, and
knew that the cabin of his nearest neighbor was in
flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opening the door, he stepped out into the open air.
The sky for a great distance presented a lurid spectacle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking toward the lower end of the small flat upon
which he was located, he saw, as he expected, a cabin
on fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crack! crack! of a rifle greeted his ears as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>was on the point of starting for the cabin. What did
all these shots mean? Was the fire the work of an
incendiary, and had murder been added to arson?</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell, hunter, scout, and Indian fighter, as
brave a man as ever stood six feet two without boots,
compressed his lips tightly, and into his sharp, homely,
honest face there crept an expression of grim resolution.
Rifle in hand, he started on a run for the burning
cabin, and was about halfway to the spot when he
caught sight of a man, a stranger, running from the
fire and toward the brush at the outlet of a ravine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crack! went Angell’s rifle, and the runner, with an
unearthly scream, fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cabin was in ruins as the scout passed it to
reach the form of the man he had shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was near the victim, who was lying on his face,
when he heard a faint voice calling him from the
bushes on his right. He stopped, said loudly, “Who’s
that?” and, receiving no answer, walked quickly toward
the place whence the voice had come.</p>

<p class='c007'>The light was still strong enough for Angell to see
about him, and he was near the bushes when he saw a
section of the buckskin habiliments of a man who was
lying on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you, Bart?” asked a faint voice, as the scout
reached the bushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great Cæsar’s ghost!” ejaculated Angell, as his
eyes rested on the face of the prostrate man in buckskin.
“Buffalo Bill!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts tried to rise, but the effort was
a failure. “I—I am all right, Bart,” he said, with an
attempt at a smile. “Lost blood that I need in my
business, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Angell quickly made an examination of Buffalo
Bill’s hurt. He had been shot in the side, and it was
impossible then to tell how serious was the injury. But
after the wound had been washed and bandaged and a
generous stimulant had been administered, the king
of scouts diagnosed his case, and, as it proved, correctly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bullet did not go straight into my anatomy,
Bart. That’s a cinch.” He felt along his side. “It
struck a rib, glanced and shot upward. I can feel it
under the skin near the armpit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I’ll purceed ter seperate it from yer person,
old son,” remarked Angell, and with his hunting knife
he deftly performed this bit of surgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation over, he said: “I’ve shore got ter ask
yer ter excuse me fer a few minutes. Thar’s a measly
rickaroon at the edge of ther flat that is claimin’ my
attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come to remember, I did hear your Peter Erastus
speak just before I called to you, Bart. Did you
bring down your man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The homely scout snorted. “Do I know how ter
shoot? Buffalo, I’m ashamed on ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he walked away, and was soon
bending over the form of his victim. The man was
not dead, but the end was not far off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angell raised the victim’s head and gazed sharply
into the pale face. The man was an utter stranger.
He had a large mouth, a retreating chin, and little eyes
set close together. Upon his face was a stubby, reddish
growth of hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eyes opened after some whisky had been poured
down the man’s throat.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“Got me fer keeps,” was the hoarse remark, the little
eyes blinking furiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yer shore goin’ ter peter,” replied Angell gravely;
“an’, bein’ ez that aire so, it’s up ter you ter tell ther
truth. Why d’ye fire ther cabin an’ shoot Buffalo Bill,
an’ whatever hev become of Matt Holmes, who lived
in ther cabin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never shot no one,” said the dying man. “I sot
ther cabin on fire, an’ that’s all I did. I aimed ter
do ther killin’, but it war done—war done—by——”
The voice ceased, and a few seconds later Bart Angell
was looking at the face of a dead man.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a sour face, the slayer left the body and returned
to the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t git thar in time fer a satisfactory auntymottim,
as them aire crowner fellers would say,” he
announced. “Ther skunk went up ther flume without
tellin’ all he knowed about ther fire an’ ther shootin’.
But”—his countenance lighting up—“mebbe you kin
fill in ther blanks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who was the man you killed?” inquired Buffalo
Bill eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hanged ef I know. Some ornery cuss that looks
as ef he war three parts idjut.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he well dressed and a good looker in the face?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not by a jugful. He aire as homely as a hedge
fence, and he wears the clothes of a scarecrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the villain who is responsible for this night’s
work has escaped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do ye know him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t know him, but”—and there was a
world of determination in the tone—“I am going to
know him, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>He paused, and his eyes flashed ominously.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was silence for a while, and then Angell said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s mighty queer ter find you here, Buffalo. I
didn’t know you war in this yer neck o’ woods. When
did ye come, an’ what’s all this business about? War
you visitin’ Matt Holmes when ther cabin war sot
afire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was, and I have a pretty long story to tell, Bart.
Suppose we defer explanations until I get to your
shack and have rested a bit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That proposition is shore all right,” replied Angell.
“Ye can’t walk, but I’ll tote ye along ther trail ’thout
any trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no hurry, Bart. Before we leave, I want
to make sure that Matt Holmes is dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ther galoot I laid out allowed ther war killin’
done,” said Angell, “an’ so I reckon that Holmes war
murdered. Whar’ll I look fer him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw him go out the front door and start for the
brush.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I’ll shore do some projeckin’ in ther brush.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Angell went away, and soon returned with the statement
that he had found the dead body of the owner
of the cabin. The murdered man had been discovered
at the mouth of the ravine. He had been shot a number
of times. One bullet had penetrated the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill sighed. “I would have prevented the
murder if the fiend had not surprised us. I was shot
just before Holmes made for the door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, the king of scouts noticed that Angell
had his hand behind his back. “Found something,
Bart?” he said quietly. “Trot it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Angell brought to view a white handkerchief. He
had found it near the body of the murdered man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts took the handkerchief and examined
it carefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one corner was a Chinese laundry mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not a detective, Bart,” said Buffalo Bill, as
he scrutinized the mark, “or I might trace this wipe
to its owner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would be a hard job”—with a shake of the head—“fer
ther nearest chink joint is in Denver. Hold
yer horses,” he added suddenly. “I’m clean off my
base. Thar’s one in Taos. It shore opened up six
months ago. I war in ther town when ther chink piked
in from Austin. I’ll bet a quirt ther rag came from
Taos.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill put the handkerchief into his breast
pocket. “I’ll try Taos if I don’t make the riffle in these
mountains. The evidence I want may be on the body
of the man you killed. Go back again and search the
pockets. Bring everything here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Angell went away for the second time, and when
he returned he brought a purse containing a few dollars
in silver, a knife, a revolver, a plug of tobacco,
and a match box with the initials “T. D.” engraved
upon an oval.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts was disappointed. The match
box was the only clew to the identity of the dead man,
and even it might prove valueless. The initials might
belong to somebody else. The box might have been
found or stolen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know any one whose name will fit these
initials?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Lemme think,” replied Angell, as he stroked his
chin. “It’s more’n likely that it stands fer Tom. As
fer ‘D’—jumpin’ Jehosophat! Ther galoot is Tom
Darke; Lanky Tom, that ther sheriff of Santa Fe was
achin’ ter catch when I war down that way three
months ago. I seen ther bills describin’ ther critter, an’
thar’s no mistook about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon you’re right,” returned Buffalo Bill
quietly. “I remember the case. Darke was implicated
in a dastardly murder. He was the tool, not the
principal. Jared Holmes, a merchant of Santa Fe, was
assassinated at his home. It was after dark, and he
was sitting in front of an open window. A shot was
fired from without, and the bullet entered his brain. A
man answering the description of Tom Darke was
seen running away from the house; there was other
circumstantial evidence connecting him with the crime,
and so the officers tried to overhaul him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell nodded. “Tom war a tinhorn gambler,
and ther sheriff told me that, onct whilst how-come-ye-so,
Tom let out ter a feller he war drinkin’ with that
he war workin’ fer a boss that war shore comin’ in fer
all kinds of money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s face was grave. “Do you know,” he
said, “that Jared Holmes was the brother of Matt
Holmes, whose dead body lies out there in the brush?
The motive that prompted the killing of Jared was the
same that prompted the taking off of Matt. But I
won’t go into details now. Help me to get to your
cabin, and after a while I’ll talk more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no revelation that night. The king of
scouts was in a fainting condition when Angell’s cabin
was reached. A second dressing to his wound was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>given, and he was put to bed. Next morning he awoke
with mind clear and only a slight physical weakness.</p>

<p class='c007'>After breakfast, he said: “I realize that you are
anxious to know exactly what happened at the cabin
of Holmes, and I believe you will work better after I
have relieved your curiosity. By this you will understand
that there is work for you to do. The bodies
down on the flat must be buried. We are many hundreds
of miles from a town and a coroner, and so we
must act as if we represented the government of the
Territory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Angell went outside, and presently appeared with a
pick and shovel. Resting the implements against the
wall, he said as he came forward to sit on a stool by
Buffalo Bill’s bunk: “Go ahead. You aire ther judge
an’ I’m ther sheriff.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was in Hayes City a few weeks ago,” the king
of scouts began, “and was figuring on going up to
Laramie for a spell to look after my interests near the
place, when an old army friend, Major Kent, met me
and asked a service. A young woman, daughter of a
West Point classmate, was in town, and it was her
desire to proceed at once to the cabin of Matt Holmes,
in these hills. The matter was important, and she
needed a guide and protector. Would I act in that
double capacity? I did not give an answer until I had
taken a look at the young woman. Then I capitulated.
I have seen many pretty women, Bart, but none prettier
than Myra Wilton. And, best of all, she is as
good as she is pretty. I would have been a brute if I
had not consented to take charge of her and see her
safely to her destination.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two days sufficed for preparations, and one fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>morning, mounted on ponies, we set out across the
plains for the mountains. It was not long before I
had her full confidence. She told me something that
both surprised and vexed me. She had journeyed
from her home in Pennsylvania on the say-so of a letter
written by a man who was an utter stranger to her.
The letter was from Santa Fe, and was signed ‘James
Loftus,’ and set forth that, as the attorney of Matt
Holmes, her uncle, it was his duty to inform her that
her uncle had but a few months to live. He had met
with an accident while out hunting, and was now waiting
for the end to come. His brother Jared was
dead, and she was his only living relative. There was
something of the utmost importance, relating to his
possessions, which he desired to communicate to her.
He dared not trust to the post, for he had an enemy
who possessed satanic craft. Therefore, he asked
that she come to him, and at once. She could find a
guide in Hayes City. The journey was not a hard
one, and he hoped to see her before a month had
passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know all the law sharps in Santa Fe, or in the
Territory, for that matter, and no one of them answers
to the name of Loftus. The statement that Holmes
had an enemy also made me regard the letter as shady.
But I did not voice my suspicions for fear of alarming
Miss Wilton. I would guide her to Holmes’ place, and
see to it that she met with no harm. I know now that
I made a mistake. Better for her had we turned back
and never attempted to cross the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! Did ye lose her?” queried Angell, with
marked concern written on his homely face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I lost her,” replied Buffalo Bill despondingly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“We were within half a mile of her uncle’s cabin, and
I had begun to think that my suspicions were groundless,
when I heard shots coming from the direction of
the cabin. I spurred on ahead, and did not look behind
me until I was in sight of the cabin. Then I
turned. Miss Wilton was not in sight. Supposing
that she had failed to make good time and would soon
show herself, I waited.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon a shout from the cabin made me turn and
face the door. There stood Matt Holmes, as well as
ever. I had known him for years, and when he
shouted, ‘Look out, Cody, or they’ll get you,’ I ducked
my head, and thus escaped a bullet fired from the
brush.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next moment I was on the ground. I got to
the cabin, and as soon as I entered, Holmes closed the
door. ‘My enemy has found me,’ he explained, ‘and
we are goin’ to have a picnic.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurriedly I informed him that his niece was outside,
and that she had come in response to the instructions
of a lying letter. The statement was no sooner
made than we heard a woman’s scream. I was about
to dash for the door, when a bullet fired from behind—the
back door must have been open—brought me
to the floor. As I fell I heard other shots, saw Holmes
rush out of doors, and then I fainted. I came to my
senses to find the cabin on fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How I got outside in time to prevent cremation I
do not know. But I managed it somehow, and in the
brush fainted again. I was opening my eyes when
you came, Bart. Now you know all I have to tell.
The enemy of Matt Holmes has won the first moves
in the diabolical game he is playing. He has committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>two murders, and he has carried off Myra Wilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shore hope he ar’n’t aimin’ to murder her,” said
Angell, with a white face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not likely,” was the confident response. “He
has other designs. She is too pretty to kill.” As he
spoke a frown came to his brow, and he bit his lip
viciously. “Confound this wound of mine. I won’t be
able to get about and do business for hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But yer humble sarvint ain’t in ther same fix,” responded
Angell quickly. “I am shore on deck, an’,
what’s more, I’m pinin’ ter git on ther trail of ther
pizen hounds that’s moseyed off with ther gal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” said the king of scouts, his face clearing
instantly. “Start as soon as you like. I am able to
look out for myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten minutes later Bart Angell was on the flat with
pick and shovel. The duty of burial performed, he set
out up the ravine which had brought Buffalo Bill and
Myra Wilton to the flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been gone an hour when a tall man, with
face covered by a black mask, stole up to the cabin that
held the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the small window on the side, he peered
in and saw Buffalo Bill propped up on the bunk and
calmly smoking a pipe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door was open, and a few minutes later the
man appeared in front of it. In his hand was a revolver,
and the king of scouts looked up to gaze into
the muzzle of the weapon.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment of silence followed:</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Buffalo Bill spoke coolly: “Looks as if you
had the drop.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TABLES ARE TURNED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The man with the mask emitted a soft chuckle. “Appearances
in this case are not deceitful, William,” he
suavely replied. “I have the drop, and you are exactly
where I want you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With the words he stepped into the room, but did
not close the door. Placing a stool on one side of the
opening, he coolly sat down, his revolver the while
still pointed at the head of the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill went on smoking, and, though his face
was pale, there was no sign of fear upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was silence for a few moments, and then the
scout said quietly: “If you are in no hurry to shoot,
why not lower that gun of yours? It might go off
accidentally and bring my partner here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked villain smiled evilly. “Your partner
won’t come here to-day. He has gone where you are
soon to go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill could draw but one conclusion from the
words. Bart Angell had been surprised and killed.
And a knife, instead of a pistol, had been used.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gazing steadily at the masked man, the intrepid
border king thus voiced his opinion of the murderer:
“I have met with all sorts of reptiles in my time, but
never one who was so meanly detestable as yourself.
You slimy, rotten, crawling apology for a human
being, why don’t you blaze away? I’d rather slip up
the flume than remain a minute longer in your company.
The vilest degenerate that ever sucked air into
his lungs is a saint alongside of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Quick as a flash, the now thoroughly incensed villain
raised the revolver, which had been slightly lowered
while the king of scouts was speaking, and fired.
The bullet cut a lock from the wounded scout’s temple,
whereat he laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is no laughing matter,” growled the assassin.
“You escaped that time, but I’ll get you with the next
bullet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe you will,” composedly responded the other,
“but you’ll get through with your business with me
before you really try to kill me. I’m on to you,
Mister Man, and if I hadn’t guessed that you are not
yet ready to extinguish my light, I would never have
invited you to cut loose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The murderer lowered his pistol. His expression
of hate gave way to one of admiration. “You are the
limit, Cody,” he grudgingly remarked. “You are
sharp, all right, but you’ll need all your wits, and a
cartload besides, to get out of the fix you are now in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think so?” said Buffalo Bill calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do. I have you where I want you. Your partner
is dead, and we are hundreds of miles from a
human habitation. When our little séance is over, one
man will be the only living thing in these solitudes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about the girl? Isn’t she near by?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked man scowled. “Yes, she is not far
away,” he admitted, “and much good may the information
do you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have left her up the ravine somewhere, I
suppose?” insinuated the scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No matter where I have left her. You’ll never see
her. But a truce to this profitless chin music. I am
going to ask you a few questions, and I have an idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>that you will answer them promptly, for as long as you
continue on that line I’ll hold back the bullet meant
for your brain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am in the humor for frankness,” said Buffalo
Bill easily. “Fire away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked murderer showed surprise, but he
quickly repressed the emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were a friend of Matt Holmes, were you not?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had no better friend. I had known him for
twenty years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you know all his secrets?” The question was
eagerly asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe I did and maybe I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, the king of scouts was feeling about
his person for a match with which to relight his pipe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll come down to cases. Did he tell you when you
met him last night that he was looking for the coming
of an enemy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked man started slightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did he say about me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The questioner leaned forward, the eyes behind the
mask winking rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hands of the king of scouts were now out of
sight under the blanket, which reached to his waist. So
intent was the murderer upon the matter of the answer
he expected his victim to make that, for one short
moment, he lost caution. The lapse was fatal to his
plan of ultimate murder.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two lightninglike movements on the part
of Buffalo Bill. His hands came into view. In each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of them was a revolver, and the masked murderer,
starting back, found himself covered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drop that gun of yours!” commanded the scout
harshly, “and be mighty quick about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The beaten villain allowed the weapon to fall to
the floor of the cabin. There was an explosion, but the
bullet did no other damage than to make a hole in the
wall under the bunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation was reversed. The king of scouts
now held the whip hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holding his pistols in a menacing way, he kicked
off the blankets and sat on the edge of the bunk, with
his feet resting on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The party of the first part has had his innings,”
he coolly remarked, “and now it is up to the other
party in the controversy to do a little stunt in the way
of examination. Need I state that a failure to answer
questions will result in some effective pistol play,
or are you wise to the dangerous position in which you
stand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The masked murderer was trembling with fear and
rage. He did not reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take off that mask,” was the stern command.
“Take it off or I will shoot it off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mask was removed with celerity, and the face
of a young man was revealed. It was dark and
smooth, and not unhandsome, but the thin lips, the
glint of the light-blue eyes and a certain hardness of
expression, betokened a selfish and cruel nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked long and intently at the
man. Suddenly his face lightened. He smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I remember you,” he said quietly. “Wild Bill reformed
Dodge City a few years ago. Gave the tough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>ones twenty-four hours’ notice to leave town. The
chief of the disreputable outfit, a man who tried highway
robbery when the money did not flow in rapidly
enough from card cheating, was one Rixton Clay. You
are the hombre.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The murderer showed his teeth. His face was as
pale as death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill went on calmly: “Clay is not your
real name. I’ll bet it’s Holmes, and that you are the
cousin of Myra Wilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The expression that came to the villain’s face
showed that the king of scouts had made a correct
guess. The latter proceeded with increased confidence:
“You are in a scheme to capture a rich estate.
That’s plain. Somebody, relative of Jared and Matt
Holmes, Myra Wilton, and yourself, has died recently.
With the Holmes brothers and the girl out of the way,
you will become the sole heir to the fortune. I am
right, eh?” No answer. “Of course I am right.
Come, own up, for you are on the toboggan, and a
close mouth won’t save you from the fate that awaits
the murderer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing to say,” replied Rixton Clay slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, but you have,” said Buffalo Bill, as he brought
his revolver nearer the head of his victim. “You have
a whole lot to say. You are going to tell me all about
your game. You are going deep into details. You are
going to tell me how Jared Holmes was killed, by your
orders, in Taos, and how you afterward killed the
slayer when you had no further use for his services.
You are going to do a whole lot of talk, and you are
going to begin right now. One, two, three——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right”—the words were jerked out—“I’ll talk.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Curse, you! I wish I had killed you when I first
caught sight of your face.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill shrugged his shoulders and grinned.
“You were a fool, and no mistake. But as I am the
winner by your bad break, I’ll not raise a kick. Now,
what is your true name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rixton Holmes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Myra Wilton is your cousin, is she not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is this fortune you are scheming to get?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a mine in Colorado.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who owned it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My uncle, Peter Holmes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother of Jared and Matt, and the mother of
Myra, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes”—surlily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When did Peter die?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Last month.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How? Why”—he hesitated, and then said with
lowered head—“some one killed him while he was
down in the mine inspecting a new lead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, I see. You began with Peter and finished with
Matt.” There was disgust and repulsion on the scout’s
honest face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never say I killed him,” returned Rixton
Holmes defiantly. “The mystery of his death will
never be cleared up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There you’re wrong,” was the cool response. “The
mystery has been cleared up. But it won’t be necessary
to try you for the crime. When the court gets
through with you for your other offenses, there won’t
be anything left of you for further trial.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Rixton Holmes shivered, then suddenly straightened
up and looked resolutely at the king of scouts. “I am
ready to die now,” he said, as he tried to steady his
voice. “I have got through talking. Kill me. I don’t
care.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill appeared to consider the matter. “Why
not?” he said. “In these wilds I can be judge, jury,
and executioner, and no one would blame me. It is
the safe thing to do.” He tightened his grip on his
pistols. The victim stiffened, expecting a report to
come. But neither trigger was pressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But,” the scout went on, “there is the poetic side
of the case to consider. If I were to kill you now, your
suffering wouldn’t amount to a hill of beans. You
ought to suffer agonies; and, by the crawling catamount,
you shall. I’ll take you to Taos, and there
you shall stay in jail until the scaffold is ready for
you to drop from. You shall hear the carpenters as
they hammer the thing into shape. Every nail driven
will be a nail in your coffin. Yes, to Taos you go.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker rose to his feet. “I am not in the best
of condition,” he continued, “and, therefore, I must
ask you to assist me a little. Here are some rawhides”—tossing
them. “Please tie your wrists for me.
I think I will be able to do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes regarded the king of scouts in contemptuous
surprise. “Do you take me for a blanked
idiot?” he said. “If you want me tied, you’ll have to
do the tying yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A bullet scraped the villain’s ear. “You must take
another look at your hand,” remarked the shooter
sharply. “You spoke without taking stock of your
situation.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>With an angry expletive, Holmes took the cords
and began to follow the scout’s directions. He was
thus occupied when a noise in the bushes outside made
him cease operations and look queerly at Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts walked quickly to the door and
looked out with one eye. The other he kept glued to
the face of Rixton Holmes. He had the forethought
not to expose his body, but stood upon one side of the
opening.</p>

<p class='c007'>A peculiar, hissing sound from the bushes brought a
similar sibilant exhibition from within the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, instantly alive to the new danger that
menaced him, leaped across the room and dealt Holmes
a crushing blow behind the ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the villain collapsed in a heap on the floor, the
king of scouts started for the door for the purpose of
closing it, when a series of bloodcurdling yells broke
upon his ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>The yells were followed by the appearance of a score
of painted savages. They were in full view from
the door before Buffalo Bill could reach it. Instantly
his revolvers cracked, and howls and screams announced
the result of his shots. Having fired several
times with the effect of driving the redskins back to
the bushes, he closed the door and shot the bolt. This
done, he turned his attention to the villain on the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Holmes’ senses returned, he was bound hand
and foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>No gag was applied. The king of scouts desired a
little further information from his victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would probably be some time before the Indians
made a new demonstration, and the scout had a faint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>hope that the lull might furnish something that would
take the edge off the grave danger that confronted him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know these savages,” he said harshly to
Holmes. “Their coming was not unexpected. Do they
play a part in this villainous scheme of yours?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It can do me no harm to answer that question,” replied
the villain, with a malicious grin. “They are
friends of mine, and I knew they were coming.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why have they come? You did not need them to
aid you in the murder of Matt Holmes, nor in the
abduction of Myra Wilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No”—the grin broadening—“but I need them to
assist me in taking care of the girl. She is to be the
bride of Raven Feather, the chief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I reckon she is with them now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If she isn’t she ought to be. I left her with them
when I made my sneak to prospect this cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did the Indians know that I was here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, neither did I know you were here when I
started for the cabin. I knew some man, wounded,
was here, but my notion was that the man was my
Uncle Matt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A voice from without caused Buffalo Bill to look up
quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Raven Feather would speak with the great white
warrior, Buffalo Bill,” were the words, spoken in the
Navaho tongue, that reached the scout’s ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak, and see that your tongue is not forked,
Raven Feather,” was the cold reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tongue of Raven Feather is not the tongue of
a serpent. The words shall be straight. Raven
Feather seeks the white man who is Buffalo Bill’s
prisoner. Give Raven Feather the prisoner and Buffalo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Bill may go free. Raven Feather has no quarrel
with the great white warrior.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a lie, chief,” was the quiet reply. “You
want my scalp for the loss of the braves who fell before
the door a few minutes ago. Well, if you get it
you’ll have to suffer the loss of a few more braves. I
am in a tight place—I would be a fool not to admit it—but
I’m not going to peter out without taking a star
part in a sanguinary circus. So drop your smooth
talk, and let the fun begin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he ceased speaking, a noise at the window on
the side of the cabin nearest the bushes attracted his
attention. Quick as a flash, he wheeled and fired, and
a Navaho fell.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been the design of the treacherous Raven
Feather to distract the attention of the king of scouts
until the brave could reach the window and take a
shot at the man who had overcome Rixton Holmes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill changed his position so that the window
was no longer a point of danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Navaho chief did not again open his mouth to
speak, and for some minutes silence reigned in the
vicinity of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes lay on the floor, a placid expression
on his dark countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts regarded the villain with a frown.
“Don’t you imagine that your rescue is near at hand,”
he said, in a tone that made Holmes shiver, “for you’ll
die before a savage enters that door. I may be booked
for the last journey, but you can make up your mind
that your ticket for the infernal regions will be
punched before the redskins settle my case.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>The villain shut his eyes and did some tall thinking.
He knew that Buffalo Bill would do as he threatened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon he said: “I am willing to make a deal with
you. Raven Feather is in my employ. He will obey
my commands. Turn me loose, and you shall not be
harmed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts smiled. “What do you take me
for, a babe in arms? What, let me go free after I
know your game and am in a position to spoil it? Oh,
no, Mr. Rixton Holmes, no deal of that kind with you.
But I will tell what I am willing to do. Give orders
to those Navahos to withdraw, to light out across the
flat to the open country—I will want to see them as
they go off, you understand—and when they are a
mile away, I will go out and leave you here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where will you go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Out of the danger zone, of course,” answered the
scout promptly, but with his face turned away from
the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes considered the matter seriously. He sighed.
It went against the grain to accept Buffalo Bill’s
proposition, but he must do it, or his life would be lost.
Soon his face cleared a little. Buffalo Bill was
wounded, and therefore could not travel fast. The
Navahos, who were magnificent trailers, and knew
every foot of the country, would probably be able to
run the scout down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will accept,” he announced, and the king of
scouts, who had divined what had been passing in the
villain’s mind, repressed a smile, and responded coldly:
“Very well. You are a sensible man, sometimes. Now
elevate your voice and talk business to your cutthroat
allies outside.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Holmes shouted, and soon Raven Feather came out
of the bushes and approached the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>The command requested by Buffalo Bill was given,
and immediately the Indians withdrew, going across
the flat and into the stretch of open country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill counted eight. Four, then, must have
been slain. He waited a few moments, and then cautiously
opened the door. Three Navahos lay dead in
front of the cabin. He went around the building, and
there was the body of the fourth Indian. It lay under
the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the room, he satisfied himself that
Holmes was weaponless, then cut the bonds and told
the prisoner to get up. The savages were now half a
mile away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a few minutes I will leave you,” said the scout.
“It gravels me to let you slip out of my fingers, but I
am sure that we are destined to meet again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Five minutes later Buffalo Bill, armed with his own
and Holmes’ weapons, walked out of the cabin and
entered the bushes. He appeared to be taking a direction
that would bring him to the trail that led over the
hills to Taos.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes smiled in satisfaction. He had noticed
that the scout moved slowly, and he believed that
the wound in the side troubled him, and would prevent
quick movement away from the flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The enemy was out of sight when Holmes signaled
to the Navahos. Instantly the band wheeled and
started on a run for the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arriving at the structure, Holmes briefly explained
to Raven Feather what had happened, and
pointed to the east. “He has gone up that way,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>said. “Send out three or four of your swiftest braves,
and they’ll overhaul him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment the king of scouts was on the western
side of the cabin. His weakness had been assumed.
The wound was not troubling him much, and he felt
able to do his usual work. Entering the bushes, he
had hurried to the ravine, made a detour, circled Matt
Holmes’ cabin, and, under cover of the brush on the
western side of the flat, had crept to a spot not twenty
yards from the cabin door, about which Raven Feather
and his Navahos were standing.</p>

<p class='c007'>After four of the Indians had departed to trail the
fugitive, he heard Rixton Holmes ask Raven Feather:
“Where is the girl?” And he heard the chief answer:
“She is in the cave with my brother Crow-killer.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>BUFFALO BILL FALLS INTO A TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In reaching his position, the king of scouts had covered
his trail as far as was possible for him to do so.
But he knew that the only effect of his precaution
would be to delay the arrival of the four Navahos
who had been sent out to run him to earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the most, he had half an hour in which to continue
his retreat or make an effort to regain the ground
he had lost at the cabin. Circumstances had compelled
him to relinquish an advantage, but his mind was made
up not to leave the flat until he had had another accounting
with the murderer of Matt and Jared Holmes.</p>

<p class='c007'>He realized that the odds were against him, but the
fact did not alter his determination. “If only Bart
Angell had lived,” he said sorrowfully to himself, “the
work would be easy. With him for support, I could
rush that cabin and have Rixton Holmes by the heels
in a twinkling.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A rifle shot from the direction of the ravine brought
an expression of amazement to his fine face. Upon
the sound of the report, Raven Feather, who a moment
before had stepped into the cabin, came out accompanied
by Rixton Holmes. Their eyes met, and
one thought was in the mind of each. The Indian
trailers had come upon Buffalo Bill and shot him. No
other theory was permissible, for, if the shot had been
fired by the king of scouts, there would assuredly have
come an answering report.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief and his white employer stood a moment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>listening, and then, hearing nothing, Raven Feather
spoke rapidly to the braves who had remained with
him at the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they made for the bushes, Buffalo Bill saw to his
relief and satisfaction that Holmes and Raven Feather
were moving toward the door of the cabin. He waited
until they had entered, and then stole quickly across
the space that separated him from the little building.</p>

<p class='c007'>His movement was not observed, for the one window
of the cabin was on the other side. A slight noise
in his rear caused him to turn his head just as he was
about to step in front of the doorway and cover the
enemies within.</p>

<p class='c007'>What he saw brought a light of joy to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell, in the flesh, stood on the spot the king
of scouts had left but a few moments before. His
rifle was in his hand, and, though his face was bloody,
he held himself erect, and seemed ready for any
emergency.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill put his finger to his lips, pointed toward
the cabin door, and then wheeled, took a few steps,
and brought his revolvers to bear upon the Indian chief
and Rixton Holmes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The white villain and his savage ally were taken
completely by surprise. Holmes was sitting on the
bunk, and Raven Feather squatted on the floor in front
of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One yell from either of you,” the king of scouts
hissed, “and I shoot. Hands up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, Bart Angell appeared by his side. The
chief’s copper countenance twitched once, and then became
stolid. With the stoicism of his race, he had
quickly accepted the situation. But Rixton Holmes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>was of different metal. He groaned, and then began
to curse.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the king of scouts held the pistols, the stalwart
backwoodsman quickly and deftly bound the
limbs of the two victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation over, Buffalo Bill asked: “How many
foes have we got to face? Half an hour ago there
were eight Navahos. Four went out on hunt for me,
and afterward three left to see what had become of
the four.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon that three will be erbout ther number,”
replied Angell, with a slight smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought so, Bart. You met the four, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wiped ’em out. Yes, that war ther ticket. I had
ter, Cody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course”—with a look of appreciation. “But
the story will have to be deferred. We must settle
with the three who are out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t berleeve they’ll mosey back hyer,” was Angell’s
comment. “They’ll shorely find ther four dead
bodies, an’ they’ll naterally conclude that you hev made
tracks fer ther cabin, fer, in course, they’ll think as
how you war ther slayer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe you are right, Bart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You stay hyer a spell an’ I’ll prove I’m right. Ef
ther three aire hot-footin’ it fer ther plains I’ll soon
know, an’ waltz back an’ tell ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Angell went off, following the route taken by the
savage trio.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was out of hearing when it occurred to Buffalo
Bill that the three Indians might retreat to the cave
spoken of by Raven Feather where Myra Wilton was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>hidden a prisoner, with the chief’s brother Crow-killer
as guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this should prove to be the case, Angell might not
be able to return as soon as he had hoped when he set
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was probable that he knew nothing about the cave,
for if he had, he would assuredly have spoken of it.
Somewhat uneasy in mind, the scout lit a pipe and
began to smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observing his sober face, Rixton Holmes said maliciously:
“You are not feeling very well, in spite of
the fact that you have turned the tables on me. I’ll
bet a hat your pard doesn’t come back. He has played
in luck twice, but he’ll miss it on the third trial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“His coming here in the nick of time showed you up
as the champion liar,” returned the king of scouts
sharply. “You said you had killed him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I thought I had,” was the calm reply. “He
was lying on the ground up the ravine, looking at
something below, when I stole up, used my knife, and
tumbled him over the bank. I saw him go plunging
down a hundred feet or more, landing in a clump of
bushes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a hard man to kill,” said Buffalo Bill, as he
blew a cloud of smoke into the air, “and he won’t miss
this last trick. When he returns, the girl will be with
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you care to make a small bet on that proposition?”
asked Holmes, a queer look on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts regarded the villain curiously.
“You think you know something that I have not yet
discovered,” he said. “It’s about the cave, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it is about the cave, Cody. Your expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>assures me that you do not know where this cave is.
It would be surprising if you did. I am acquainted
with this section as well as the next man, and yet I
did not know until yesterday that there was a cave in
these parts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to acknowledge that I don’t know where
the cave is located,” replied the king of scouts, “but
that fact does not prevent me from thinking that Bart
Angell will find it. He is as good a trailer as a
Navaho, and he’ll follow the redskins to the cave if,
as I believe, they have gone there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes shook his head. “You don’t understand
the layout, Cody. The trail will be lost long before
your partner gets within a half mile of the cave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Buffalo Bill resignedly, “if Bart fails
to find the hole, he’ll come back, and then we’ll put
our heads together and try to solve the riddle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes made no reply, but he winked at Raven
Feather, who during the conversation had been gazing
placidly at the rafters of the roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill began to grow uneasy. He did not
like the attitude of his prisoners. It was evident that
they did not look upon their situation as serious. It
was also evident that they were expecting assistance.
From whom could it come? He puckered his lips
in an effort to reach a solution of the cheerful demeanor
of Holmes and the chief. Ah, the explanation
of the situation was at hand. The prisoners expected
help from Crow-killer, the chief’s brother. The three
Indians would reach the cave and tell Crow-killer what
had happened and what they feared. Crow-killer,
more shrewd and intelligent than the three braves,
would conclude that the slayer of the four Navahos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>would go to the cabin and attack the chief and the
white man, Holmes. If he succeeded in this venture,
then he would likely take the trail to find the girl. He
was now, in all probability, on the way to the cave.
Good; for while he, Buffalo Bill, the mighty warrior,
was following the trail of the three braves, Crow-killer
and the braves would be hurrying to the cabin by another
route.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus reasoned the king of scouts, but his satisfaction
over his deductions did not last long. He called
to mind the remark of Holmes that Bart Angell would
not return. The remark carried the implication that
he would be ambushed somewhere on the way to the
cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hang it,” muttered the scout, in marked vexation,
“I wish I could guess what is going on outside of this
cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes spoke up at this juncture. “I would
like to tell you a story, Cody,” he said, with a half
chuckle. “It is pretty long, but it will serve to make
the time pass pleasantly while you are waiting for your
pard. A few years ago——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cut it,” interrupted the perturbed king of scouts
as he walked to the door. “I can guess what your object
is. You want to keep me here in this room so that
Crow-killer can get a bead on me when he comes. I
won’t have it so. I am going to leave for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The smile departed from Rixton Holmes’ face.
The announcement did not please him. A terrible fear
gripped him when Buffalo Bill continued coolly: “I
shall not go far. I shall not go out of sight of the
cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>He paused, looked at the prisoners, intercepted a
glance between them, and then, to their manifest discomfiture,
walked over to them and proceeded to gag
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, satisfied that they were powerless for harm,
he went out of doors and entered the brush. Along
the trail he went until the steadily rising ground
brought him to a point whence he could command a
view of both the ravine and the flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>For more than an hour he remained at his post, and
was becoming alarmed as well as impatient at the nonappearance
of either Bart Angell or Crow-killer, and
his party, when he saw emerging from the ravine at
the southern end of the flat the forms of three Indians.
By the aid of his pocket field glass he was
able to identify Crow-killer as one of the trio. The
brother of the Navaho chief was a giant in size, and
the king of scouts had heard of his prowess in battle,
and also of his cunning and audacity. The scout had
never before been placed in a position where he could
try conclusions with the redoubtable savage, and he
was not ill pleased because an opportunity had at last
arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>He watched the Indians, saw that they were not
coming in his direction, but were cautiously making
their way across the flat so as to come upon the cabin
along the route the king of scouts himself had taken
but a short time before, and then he crept quickly and
noiselessly back to the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Entering, he assured himself that the prisoners were
as he had left them, and then he went out again.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few rods from the door was a pile of logs which
the owner of the cabin had cut for firewood.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Behind the pile Buffalo Bill hastened to conceal himself,
and there awaited the coming of his savage enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifteen minutes went by, and then the watcher detected
a movement among the bushes on the other side
of the flat and nearly opposite his hiding place. He
used his field glasses, and soon discerned the head of
an Indian. The head was within rifle range, and the
scout’s first impulse was to fire. But sensible, second
thought induced a different program. If he fired and
killed one of the savages, the others would likely take
themselves out of harm’s way, to give trouble in the
near future. No, it were best to wait and secure the
chance to either slay or bag the trio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Expecting that the Navahos would soon make for
the cabin, Buffalo Bill was disappointed and perplexed
when many minutes passed and no such move was
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head disappeared, and it was apparent that
Crow-killer and his braves had retreated farther into
the bushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be that they intended to go around the flat
and approach the cabin from the other side. Or the
delay in coming to the cabin might be attributed to
caution. Crow-killer did not know where the scout
was. He might be in the cabin, and he might be out
searching for Bart Angell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon I know what is bothering Crow-killer,”
said the king of scouts to himself. “He wants to
know the layout in the cabin before making a move
to help his brother and that villain, Holmes. Maybe
the program is to make a sneak, get to the window,
and look in.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>He was looking across the flat when there came
the report of a rifle, and a bullet struck a log a foot
above his head. This action on the part of the savages
filled the king of scouts with surprise and uneasiness.
His body could not have been seen, for he
was crouched behind the tall pile of wood, and he had
not exposed his head during his stay there. How,
then, could the Navahos know where he was?</p>

<p class='c007'>He was endeavoring to answer this question, when
a tomahawk, thrown with murderous force, whizzed by
his head. The attack had come from behind, and his
skull would have been cleft in twain if the wielder
had not slipped on the smooth, damp ground just as
the arm shot out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts sprang to his feet and met the
giant Crow-killer advancing on him with drawn knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had his rifle in his hand. Quick as lightning
he clubbed it, and brought the stock down on the
hand that held the knife.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weapon dropped to the ground, and instantly
Crow-killer leaped upon his enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had not time to again make use of the
rifle. It left his hand, and he met the rush by lowering
his head and driving it like a battering-ram
against the weakest part of the giant’s anatomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Struck squarely in the pit of the stomach, Crow-killer
doubled up, and was in the act of falling, when
Buffalo Bill, converting his right hand into a sledge
hammer, caused it to carom on the savage’s chin. The
result was what might have been expected: Crow-killer
struck the ground with a thud.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an instant the victor regained his rifle and turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to glance at the flat. The Navahos were running toward
the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>They saw him, and three reports rang out. They
were not simultaneous. Buffalo Bill, the quickest on
the trigger, fired first, and then sprang to one side,
only to fire again and again.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the smoke cleared away there were two dead
Indians on the flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a hard smile the king of scouts turned to see
Crow-killer making strenuous efforts to get to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>A couple of well-directed blows had the result desired.
The brother of the Navaho chief sought again
a horizontal position, and lay quite still.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was bound and gagged and dragged into the
cabin. Taking a stool, the victor of the recent combat
wiped his perspiring face. He had reason for
exultation, but his brow was sad. The nonappearance
of Bart Angell was disquieting. He must have
fallen into a trap and been conveyed to the mysterious
cave; and to find that cave, rescue Myra Wilton and
possibly the missing scout, was now Buffalo Bill’s fixed
intention.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was near the hour of noon. The king of scouts
prepared a meal, ate of it, and, removing the gags of
his prisoners, gave each a supply of the food. The
two Indians partook sparingly of what was offered
them, but Rixton Holmes ate like a famished wolf.
“I went off this morning without my breakfast,” he
explained to Buffalo Bill, with a nervous smile. “I
am in for it, maybe, but I’m not going to make a
fool of myself. Food imparts strength, and I may
need my strength before I leave this neck o’ woods.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Yes, I think you will,” responded the king of scouts
dryly. “Until I find horses, there’s quite a long walk
ahead of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was one horse outside. It belonged to Bart
Angell. Affixed to the pommel of the saddle was a
reata. It was a long one, and Buffalo Bill nodded approvingly
as he removed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the reata in his hand he reëntered the cabin,
and thus addressed his prisoners: “I am going to find
that cave. You three will go with me, for it would
be the height of folly to leave you here. I shall give
you the use of your feet, but your hands will remain
tied, and this reata will serve as a bond to hold you together.
The free end will be in my hand, and I shall
drive you much as I might drive so many fractious
ponies. Of course, it goes without saying that it won’t
be healthy for any one of you to disobey any order
that I may give.”</p>

<p class='c007'>None of the prisoners had anything to say. The
ankle cords were cut, the reata placed as explained,
and then Buffalo Bill pointed to the door. “March!”
he commanded, and with Rixton Holmes in the lead,
a sheepish expression on his evil face, Buffalo Bill and
his strange tandem left the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every order was obeyed as the party went along
the trail that led to the ravine. The two Indians
wore scowling faces, but Holmes was cheerful. The
king of scouts wondered at the villain’s apparent state
of mind. Was he playing a part, affecting a joyousness
that he was far from feeling, or had he some card
up his sleeve that he expected soon to play?</p>

<p class='c007'>The scout determined to get at the truth if he could.
“Holmes,” said he, when they were near the ravine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“you are a slippery cuss, and you are counting on
getting out of the hole in which I have placed you.
That’s right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A cunning look came into the villain’s face. “I’d
be a fool not to live in hopes, when I am alive and well,
wouldn’t I?” was the somewhat evasive reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose I take you straight to Taos and not try to
find this cave? Would you still have hopes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes’ jaw fell. But he quickly became composed.
“But you won’t do that,” he said. “I know you,
Cody, and I know that you will not take the trail for
Taos until you’ve made an effort to find the girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill frowned. He had learned what he desired,
and the knowledge was not such as to give him
any pleasure. Holmes was banking on something in
or about the cave. What that something was the king
of scouts had not the remotest idea. He had strong
reason to believe that it was a trap, and that Bart
Angell had fallen into it. If he went on, was able,
either through the assistance of his prisoners or by his
own ingenuity, to find the cave, he might fall a victim
to the wiles of the enemy. Three Indians had gone
from the cabin to Crow-killer at the cave. One had
been left behind, presumably to guard the fair prisoner
and also take care of the trap which must have
received the stalwart and fearless Angell. And yet,
in spite of the probable danger, of the nature of which
he could not guess, he resolved to go on. “I’ve got to,”
he muttered under his breath. “I can’t leave the girl
in the power of that Navaho, and I can’t quit this section
without ascertaining what has become of Bart
Angell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the bank of the ravine the prisoners halted without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>an order. Their eyes were directed toward a platform
of rock about halfway up the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, following the look, saw the head of
an Indian appear above some depression just beyond
the far side of the platform. Before he could raise
his rifle the head disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your cave is over there,” the scout said to Rixton
Holmes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain nodded. There was an inscrutable expression
on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a safe trail to the bottom of the ravine.
The prisoners and their custodian went down the trail,
the king of scouts keeping a sharp eye meanwhile on
the platform above.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the head did not again appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t try to go down to the cave if I were
you,” said Holmes, with affected earnestness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps you would like to become my substitute,”
returned the scout dryly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t mind,” was the cool response.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill resolved to make a careful examination
of the surroundings before attempting to get into the
cave. The trap, if there was one, must be outside the
big hole.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three prisoners were ankle-bound and gagged,
and left lying in the bed of the ravine. Then the king
of scouts, with an odd feeling in his breast, began the
ascent of the bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached the platform, but without stepping upon
it, stood up and looked at the point whence the Indian’s
head had appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no hole there. A large, flat stone occupied
the spot.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The platform was carefully inspected. There was
no break in the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ground about was next given the benefit of
searching scrutiny. Nothing unusual was presented to
the sight. “Humph!” grunted the baffled scout. “I
wonder where the monkey business is hidden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stepped upon the platform, and the answer to his
question was at once given, and in a most startling
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The huge rock sank under him, and he shot downward
twenty feet. The descent was rapid, but not so
rapid as to cause him to lose his balance when the
bottom was reached. But he had not time to act on
the defensive against the enemy, who had been awaiting
his coming. A lasso settled about his neck, and he
was jerked roughly to the hard floor of the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>A succession of heavy blows upon the head instantly
followed his downfall.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he awoke to consciousness he was lying on a
couch of skins in another part of the cave. There was
a subdued light furnished by a thin crevice in the
rocky wall over his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raising himself on an elbow, he saw a young woman
sitting on another couch and bathing the head of a
prostrate man. The man was Bart Angell, and the
young woman was Myra Wilton.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was about to speak, when Rixton Holmes came
in. The villain burst into a laugh when he saw that
the king of scouts had revived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, William the Great, what is your conclusion?
Bit off more than you could chew, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I certainly made a mistake,” replied Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mistake that can never be repaired.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>A COWARD DEFIED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Rixton Holmes turned from Buffalo Bill to Myra
Wilton. His voice was respectful as he asked: “How
is your patient. Head all right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will live,” the girl answered coldly. “I hope
it will be his good fortune to see you mount the gallows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain’s face flushed. “You seem determined
to regard me as your enemy,” he said. “Haven’t I
explained that I am acting for the best, in your interest
as well as mine?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s expression of wonderment at this
speech was increased when Myra Wilton suddenly replied
in a broken voice: “Forgive me. I—I had forgotten.
I ought to trust you, and I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes gave a sigh of relief. “That’s right,” he
said. “I am, indeed, your friend, and these two scouts,
honest men though they are, have been working
against you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a liar,” put in the king of scouts hotly.
“I can’t guess what you have said to Miss Wilton to
make her believe that you are not a thief and a murderer,
but your statement, whatever it was, was a lie.
You are not her friend. You are her enemy, and you
are scheming to get the fortune which, by the death
of Matt Holmes, is now hers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes was not disconcerted at these accusing
words. Looking at the girl, he said quietly: “For
Mr. Cody’s benefit, read the letter that was found on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the body of Tom Darke, the wretch who killed your
Uncle Matt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra Wilton wiped her eyes, and then, from the
little bag that was hooked to her waist belt, took out a
letter and read these words:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Niece</span>: I am daily looking for you to
make your appearance here, but it may be ordained
that we are never to meet in this life. I have a bitter,
remorseless enemy. His name is Tom Darke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hired by Rixton Holmes to murder Jared Holmes
in Taos.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The interruption came from Bart Angell. He was
sitting up, and he winked at Buffalo Bill as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mistake,” said the villain calmly. “Go on with
the reading, Miss Wilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl, who had shown no surprise at the interruption,
continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has threatened to kill every member of the
Holmes family. The reason for his deadly enmity is
the incarceration of his father for burglary, conviction
of the crime being due to the evidence of my
father, whose house was burglarized. I have received
information that Darke is in New Mexico. I am
sure he is seeking me. I trust that I may see you before
he finds me, but if I am gone when you arrive,
this letter will inform you that I have made a will
leaving all my property to you and my nephew, Rixton
Holmes. In the event of the death of either of
you, the survivor is not to inherit the estate of the
dead one, but said estate is to become the property
of the Territory, and is, when converted into cash, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>be used in hunting down and punishing my murderer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all,” said the girl, as she folded the letter
and placed it in the bag.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes immediately followed the reading with this
explanation: “Because I could not convince Mr. Cody
that I was an honest man, one who had been the
friend, not the enemy, of Matt Holmes, I permitted
him to assume that I was all that his fertile imagination
had painted me. I went to Bart Angell’s cabin,
not expecting to find him there, and if I acted as if
I were not on the side of law and decency, it was because
I feared that he, in his mistaken idea of the
situation, would butt in and prevent me from looking
after my own and Miss Wilton’s interests. And what
applies to Buffalo Bill applies, and has applied, to his
partner, Bart Angell. They have been used roughly,
but there was no other way by which they could have
been rendered powerless for harm. It is necessary,
in order to obtain the fortune that my uncle has left
to me and my Cousin Myra, that we should be in
Denver one week from to-day. The mine in which the
fortune lies is in litigation. The case will be called
next week, and only by my testimony can the mine be
saved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes looked from Angell to the king of scouts,
a complacent smile on his dark face.</p>

<p class='c007'>As neither one of his auditors had anything to say
at this juncture, he went on coolly: “The mix-up with
the Indians to-day is an unfortunate affair. They are
friends of mine, and they are not at war with the government.
They came with me in order to protect my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>uncle. I had heard that Tom Darke was on the way
to the flat, and, fearing that murder was in his heart,
I induced Raven Feather and a few of his braves to
accompany me. We arrived too late to prevent arson
and murder, but not too late to slay the murderer.
In his pocket I found the letter Miss Wilton has just
read. Darke probably stole it from the cabin while
my uncle was away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A quick, meaning glance passed between Myra Wilton
and Buffalo Bill. The latter, without looking at
Holmes, said harshly: “I am most surprised that your
cousin has accepted your statement. It must have
seemed plausible. And it will do no good to say that
what I have said before, that you are a liar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not an ounce of good. You mean well, but you
are wrong regarding your humble servant,” replied
the villain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I came mighty nigh, I shore did, in bein’ off
my ca-base on your account,” put in Bart Angell dryly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain grinned. “You played in hard luck, all
right, but there are good times coming to you.” Then
he spoke with simulated seriousness. “In an hour I
shall leave the cave for the trail eastward. My cousin
will go with me. Raven Feather has been instructed
to hold both of you here for a week. Then you will
be released. If you are inclined, you can come to
Denver, where I will be pleased to give you whatever
satisfaction you may require.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, unperceived by the villain, Buffalo Bill, and
Myra Wilton exchanged meaning glances. Presently
Holmes stooped, whispered something to the girl,
whereupon she arose and followed the villain from the
apartment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>They passed through a narrow opening into a large
grotto, at the farther end of which was the trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two scouts waited until assured that Holmes
was out of hearing distance, and then began to converse
in low tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The girl is all right,” said Buffalo Bill confidently.
“She takes no stock in the fairy tale that Holmes reeled
off to her, though, for reasons that we must both appreciate,
she is pretending that she believes it as gospel
truth. That letter, of course, is a forgery. It
was written to deceive the girl. Rixton Holmes will
not kill her as he has killed Jared and Matt Holmes
if she will consent to marry him. See the point, Bart?
He is trying to work himself into her good graces.
He dared not attack either my character or yours, but
he thinks he has made the riffle, all the same. We are
well-meaning, honest men, but we have got the wrong
pig by the ear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell gave a snort of disgust. “He’s ther
wust specimen of a white man that I ever went up
ergin, Cody. An’ ter think he was cute ernuff ter lay
ther pair of us by ther heels. I feel like kickin’ myself
in twenty-two places. Rats an’ little fishes, but I’m
plumb ashamed of myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you hurt much?” asked Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I got a rap on the coconut when I drapped
down ther hole, but I’m feelin’ now in condition ter
tackle ther hull murderin’ outfit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you trail the three Navahos to the cave?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It ermounts ter ther same thing, Cody. I follered
ther trail to ther bottom of ther ravine, and while I
war down thar I seen an Injun poke his head out of a
hole up ther bank, on ther far side of a big flat rock.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“I have a hunch that our experiences were identical,
Bart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then they shore ain’t anything ter brag erbout.
We war two innercent, mush-headed flies, an’ that thar
Injun, who insinivated his pesky cabesa outer ther
hole, war ther foxy spider. Waugh! Gimme a smoke,
Cody. I wanter to take ther taste outer my mouth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill laughed. It was not a mirthful laugh.
“As my hands are tied, and as you are in the same fix,
Bart, I don’t see how I can accommodate you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye’ve got ter,” persisted Angell. “Ef ye refuse
ter whack up with ther terback—ther measly Injun
who worked ther spider game swiped mine—I’ll shore
hev ter take it away from yer by main force an’ awkwardness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked queerly at his friend. The
big backwoodsman was more than half in earnest. As
his eyes met those of Buffalo Bill, a big grin overspread
his homely face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s your play,” quietly remarked the king of
scouts. “Bring out your cold deck and proceed to do
me up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For answer, Bart Angell spread his legs. The cords
that had secured his ankles had been cut, and there
between them lay the knife which had performed
the operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bending forward and downward, not without a
painful effort, Angell took the knife between his teeth.
Then he lifted his hands and quickly severed the cords
that bound his wrists.</p>

<p class='c007'>A minute later Buffalo Bill, like his comrade, was
free of his bonds. “It war ther girl,” said Angell,
his voice in a whisper. “She did ther trick while that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>ornery hound of a Holmes war unwinding his rotten
yarn off onto you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The scouts searched the chamber for weapons, but
found none.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disappointed, but not daunted, Buffalo Bill stole to
the narrow corridor through which Holmes and the
girl had departed, and listened intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>The faint sound of voices in the outer and main
apartment of the cave told him that his enemies were
still underground. He went forward into the corridor
until he was able to both see and hear. The corridor
had many projections, the walls nowhere were even,
and he quickly found a hiding place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes was speaking in the Navaho tongue
when the king of scouts reached his shelter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Raven Feather shall have his revenge,” he said, in
a cold, even tone. “After I have gone, the cave and
all that is in it is yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My brother will depart alone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was savage eagerness in the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” was the firm answer. “The white maiden
will go with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My white brother forgets,” returned the chief, with
equal firmness. “He promised that the maiden should
become the squaw of Raven Feather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Circumstances alter cases,’” said the villain coolly.
“I had not seen the girl when I made the promise.
She will become the wife of Rixton Holmes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was silence for a few moments. Buffalo Bill,
his interest at fever heat by the unexpected development,
waited for the next words of the chief of the
Navahos.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>But it was Crow-killer, the chief’s brother, who was
the next speaker.</p>

<p class='c007'>The giant in a guttural rumble sided with Raven
Feather. He insisted that the promise must not be
broken. Raven Feather had agreed to help the white
man, and his reward was to be the white maiden. The
white man must leave her behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes compressed his lips, and his eyes flashed
ominously. He was not a brave man, and his demeanor
under the circumstances puzzled Buffalo Bill
exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Addressing the girl in English, the villain said:
“Go back to the other chamber. There is a hitch.
My friends, Raven Feather and Crow-killer, object to
your departure. I must smooth them down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As she moved away, the king of scouts drew a deep
breath. He felt that a crisis was approaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra Wilton was about to pass his place of concealment,
her eyes looking straight ahead, when the king
of scouts touched her on the arm, whispering these
words at the same time: “I am watching the grotto.
There is likely to be a mix-up. Tell Angell I need
him here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl frowned. “You must not harm Mr.
Holmes,” she said, also in a whisper. “He gave me
the knife, and told me to free your partner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had met with many surprises in his life,
but never one so great as this. He stared at her without
speaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a villain,” she quietly went on, “but he means
you no harm. I have seen to that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t understand,” said Buffalo Bill, as he shook
his head.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“You will after a while. Rely on me. I know
what I am about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe you do,” muttered the scout under
his breath. But what he said was this: “I’ll not hurt
Holmes while you are in your present state of mind;
but I may pay my respects to Raven Feather and his
big brute of a brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have no objection,” she replied, and then left
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, the two Indians and Rixton Holmes
were talking together in angry tones. The white stubbornly
held his ground, and the Indians finally came
to the conclusion that he was not relying on his own
unaided efforts to carry his point.</p>

<p class='c007'>They might have leaped upon him, and either killed
or made him a prisoner, but a suspicion that caused
them both to look toward the corridor separating the
two sections of the cave made them pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>A lull in the conversation was broken by the descent
of the trap. The Navaho who had guarded the prisoners
while Crow-killer was away with the two braves
jumped from the platform, and made this report to
Raven Feather: “When the moon rises, the chief
shall welcome the braves of the village.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Raven Feather gave a slow nod of approval. Then
he looked steadily at Holmes. “Does my brother understand?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course,” was the response, given with indifference.
“The other members of your band are coming
from the village. It is now late afternoon. They will
reach here in four or five hours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain smiled, and then proceeded: “But I
won’t be here when they arrive.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“If my white brother is not here then, it will be because
he has kept the promise he gave to Raven
Feather,” returned the chief, with decision.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another smile appeared on the face of the white
man. Then he began to scratch his head, the two Indians
regarding him questioningly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have it,” he said; “we’ll leave it to the maiden.
Send your brave to fetch her here, and we’ll each of
us put up his side of the case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke in English, but Raven Feather understood
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief shook his head. “The maiden shall be
brought here,” he replied, “but she shall not decide
the matter. It has been decided. She stays behind to
grace the tepee of Raven Feather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes made no response, but he grinned when the
Navaho brave started for the inner chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes Myra Wilton reappeared. She was
very pale, and her eyes sought those of her cousin in
anxious inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes beckoned, and she came to his side. He
whispered something in her ear, and she nodded in
understanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She says she prefers to go with me,” spoke the villain,
as he fixed his eyes on Raven Feather.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief grunted, and Crow-killer clenched his big
hands and gritted his teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The right hand of Holmes was resting on the butt of
his revolver in the holster at his belt. He was eying
Crow-killer when Buffalo Bill, followed by Bart Angell,
sprang into the grotto.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their appearance only became known to the Indians
when each was attacked. The king of scouts paid his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>respects to Crow-killer, while Bart Angell tried conclusions
with Raven Feather.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the instant of the assault of the two scouts Rixton
Holmes leaped upon the trap platform. Myra
Wilton had already taken her position there.</p>

<p class='c007'>While a terrific struggle was going on in the grotto
the platform rose, and the villain and the girl were in
the open air long before the struggle ended.</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra Wilton stepped from the platform, her lovely
face flushed with anger. “I did not expect this,” she
indignantly exclaimed. “You told me you would stay
behind to assist Mr. Cody and his partner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are able to get away with the redskins without
my help,” he quickly replied. “I saw that they
were having things their own way before I jumped
on the platform.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not believe you,” she said stoutly. “You must
go back. Perhaps your return may prevent a tragedy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t go back,” was his harsh reply. “That is
out of the question.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl sat down on the edge of the platform.
“Then you may go on without me,” she declared, a
determined expression on her face. “If you will not
go back to the cave, I will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think not, my dear cousin. You are going with
me.” There was a look in his eyes that she had never
seen there before.</p>

<p class='c007'>A shudder ran through the girl’s frame. But she
called up her courage as she said: “Have you been
lying to me? Did you not tell the truth when you said
that you meant no harm to Mr. Cody and Mr. Angell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told the truth.” But the villain did not meet the
girl’s honest eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Then,” said she, “if you don’t go back to the cave,
I must put you down as a coward. I despise a coward,”
she added, in a voice that made the man wince.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes was in a hole. He had had the faith to believe
that he could win and retain the confidence and
respect of his lovely cousin. But the time had come
when he must either expose his hand or permit her to
think that he was showing the white feather. For half
an hour no word was spoken by either of them. Then
Holmes concluded to drop deception. By so doing
there could be no change in her attitude toward himself.
Despising him for a coward, she had refused
to go on with him; therefore, take whichever horn of
the dilemma he might, he would be compelled to use
force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am not a coward,” he protested; “and at the same
time I am not a fool. I have parted company with
Raven Feather and his Navahos. They have served
my turn, and I have done with them.” With these
words he fastened the platform so that it could not be
operated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra Wilton observed the action, and a chill seized
her. She waited tremblingly for the next words of
the villain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may as well be plain with you,” he went on, as
he sat on the platform and faced her. “I had planned
a different detail in the game I have been playing. I
had hoped to win your consent to become my wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You never would have obtained it,” she said scornfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps not, but the attempt would have been
made if you had not rebuked me for refusing to go
back to the cave and fall into the hands of Buffalo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Bill. I fooled you a while ago, but I have never
fooled him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad of that,” was her quick interruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your joy won’t last,” the villain replied, with a
snicker. “He will never leave the cave. He may, he
probably has, got away with Raven Feather and Crow-killer
as he got away with the brave I sent after you,
but his victory will be a barren one. He can never
escape from below. There he will starve and rot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra Wilton looked at the speaker with eyes that
burned his soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To think,” she said slowly, “that I should for one
moment have trusted you. I would rather, far rather,
live for the balance of my life as the squaw of the
most despicable red man in these Western wilds than
become your wife. Go! I am sick of the sight of
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes arose to his feet, his countenance
black with rage. He was past the feeling of shame.
Advancing to where she sat, he extended his hands
to grasp her by the wrists.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a quick movement she was on her feet, and
Holmes started back as she drew a pistol from the
folds of her gown and pointed the muzzle at his head.
His expression of amazement and alarm brought a
smile of fierce satisfaction to her lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am able to defend myself, you see,” she coolly remarked.
“The revolver came from the person of the
Indian you sent to escort me from the chamber to the
grotto. Mr. Cody, who overcame the Indian, insisted
that I should take the weapon. The other pistol—the
Indian had two—was appropriated by Mr. Cody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“You certainly will,” cut in the girl grimly, before
the sentence could be finished. “And now,” she coolly
proceeded, “I would thank you to unbuckle your belt
and let your weapons drop to the ground. I mean
business,” she continued, in a hard, menacing voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes gnashed his teeth in the impotence
of his wrath and disgust. The position was ridiculous,
to be thus held up by a weak girl!</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that she had not immediately insisted upon
compliance with her stern order caused the villain to
breathe more freely. His cunning came to the surface.
He resolved to prolong the decisive move, hoping
to catch her off her guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hang it, Myra,” he said, “you are a thoroughbred.
Can’t we come to an amicable understanding?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked at her eagerly as he spoke. She shook
her head. “No,” was her response, “I will make no
more bargains with you. I know you now, and I shall
never trust you again. You haven’t obeyed me. Is
it possible that you failed to guess what would happen
if you refused to unbuckle that belt of yours? You
would die.” She advanced a step, and the muzzle of
her revolver was on a line with the villain’s forehead,
and not more than three feet from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the quickness of lightning, Holmes lowered
his head and propelled his body toward her. The pistol
exploded, but the bullet passed him by. The next
instant Holmes had her by the wrists.</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra Wilton screamed, and the outcry was followed
by a series of savage yells.</p>

<p class='c007'>Releasing the girl, the villain wheeled, and beheld a
score or more of Indians coming up the bank of the
ravine.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>BUFFALO BILL’S ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Rixton Holmes swore frightfully when his eyes fell
on the Indians. He knew them, and they knew him.
They were a part of the band of Raven Feather, the
chief who had, until very recently, been both his ally
and tool. They were coming toward him with friendly
intentions. He had expected their arrival at the cave,
for Raven Feather had sent for them, but they had
come long before the time announced by the chief’s
messenger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain found himself in a disturbing quandary.
If he remained to receive them, his cowardice and
treachery in respect of the chief and Crow-killer would
be discovered, and he would probably lose his life, and
Myra Wilton would fall into Raven Feather’s hands.
On the other hand, if he ran away, he would lose the
girl, and his scheme to win a fortune would come to
naught.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment’s consideration decided the matter for
him. Before the Navahos reached the platform he
was out of sight in the thick bushes on the eastward
side of the cave. Down the steep hill he went, stumbling,
falling, receiving many bruises and cuts until
his feet struck the bed of the ravine.</p>

<p class='c007'>His absence from the platform that concealed the
shaft of the cave did not surprise the leader of the
savages. The red man supposed that the white friend
of Raven Feather had gone underground to announce
the coming of the reënforcements.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Myra Wilton had been too terrified to move from
her position. She was trembling violently when the
savages crowded about the platform. No move was
made to seize or harm her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon the fact that she was for the moment safe
drove some of the fear from her face. Looking steadily
at the handsome young brave who commanded the
band, she pointed down the hill in the direction taken
by the fleeing villain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Navaho was at first in doubt as what her action
meant. But when it was repeated, with expressive addition,
he nodded, and at once gave orders which sent
two of the braves after Holmes.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the braves had gone, the Indian leader tried
the platform, and discovered that it was fastened. A
frown came into his face. He looked at the girl, and
said in Navaho: “Where is the great chief, Raven
Feather?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra pointed downward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young brave regarded her steadily for a moment,
and then went to one side of the platform, felt
under the rock, and found a concealed lever. Giving
it a pull, the lock was released.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, standing on the ground beside the platform,
the Indian, by signs, directed the girl to stand on the
trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her face paled, but she did not hesitate. Refusal
would have availed her nothing. Before her was a
score of savages, each armed to the teeth. She stepped
forward, and the Indian came to her side. Down went
the trap, and they descended, to find that the grotto
was tenantless.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Light for the apartment was furnished by a sputtering
torch stuck in a crevice of the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian stepped from the platform and listened
intently. No sound broke the stillness.</p>

<p class='c007'>He moved toward the corridor, his right hand grasping
the wrists of the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>His mystification was great, but not so great as that
of Myra Wilton. How had the struggle in the cave
terminated, and what had become of the combatants?</p>

<p class='c007'>A partial answer was afforded when the Indian and
the girl entered the inner chamber of the cave. On
the rocky floor lay Raven Feather and Crow-killer.
Each was bound and gagged, and each bore the marks
of terrible punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh!” grunted the young Navaho. Then he
looked at the girl. “What for?” he said in English.</p>

<p class='c007'>Myra’s eyes were on a large hole high up in one
corner. When she was a prisoner in the chamber
there had been no such hole. Where the hole was there
had been a crevice, which had admitted light. Facing
the Navaho, she replied quietly: “For me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The savage, whose knowledge of English was limited,
understood her, but he was unable to say in response
what he desired to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>He hesitated a moment, and then drew some leather
cords from his breast and proceeded to tie her hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The operation finished, he lifted her up and sat her
down beside the prostrate chief. Raven Feather was
in possession of his senses, and his snaky eyes twinkled
in evil satisfaction as he watched the actions of
his subordinate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes the chief and his brother were sitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>up and ready to talk. Each was stiff and sore, but
none of their hurts were serious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raven Feather’s first words were: “Where are the
braves that came with Lone Wolf?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young brave pointed toward the grotto.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some quick orders were given, and Lone Wolf went
to the grotto, where his braves were waiting, and
brought them into the chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raven Feather pointed to the hole in the wall, made
a short explanation, and followed it by some sharp instructions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of the hole sped the Indians, and it was late
in the night when they returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had failed to come upon the two scouts, but
they had a strange story to tell. It can be best told
to the reader by a recital of the adventures of Buffalo
Bill and Bart Angell, who when last seen were fighting
a battle that meant either life or death for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But each had the advantage at the outset. The two
Indians were taken by surprise, and, though they
fought with skill and desperation, victory soon came
to the scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had the heaviest contract. He was
opposed to a giant in strength, and but for the science
allied to his remarkable muscular strength, the outcome
might have been in doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the contest was over, and the chief and his
brother lay on the floor, their limbs secured with stout
leathers, the king of scouts, the perspiration running
in streams down his face, staggered to the space under
the trap, and jerked at the rope that was used to lower
the platform. He jerked in vain. The platform would
not move.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“I understand,” said the scout to his companion,
“that hound Holmes has locked the trap. We’re
caged, all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe we aire an’ maybe we ain’t, Cody. I’ve
shore corralled an idee that we aire goin’ ter beat this
game. Let’s mosey to ther other eend an’ take a squint
at that crevice whar ther light comes from.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went into the inner chamber, carrying with
them the two prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill looked up at the crevice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am afraid escape in that direction is barred,
Bart,” he said. “The redskins must have investigated
the break, and found it a case of no thoroughfare, or
they would never have allowed it to remain unguarded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell scratched his head. “I hev shore a prize
memory. I loses it, an’ now an’ ag’in it comes back
ter me. It’s comin’ back now. Cody, I’ve shore struck
it. I know all about this yer hole. It’s a double-ender.
We’re in one part of it, but thar’s a bigger
part, an’ it’s on t’other side of that crevice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill ceased to be in a state of gloom. “Are
you sure?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Plumb sure. Ther hull business, descrip’ an’ everything
hev come back ter me. Squat, an’ I’ll eloocerdate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They sat down, and after filling their pipes Angell
began. “I wouldn’t take ther time now ter do any
talkin’ ef I didn’t feel that we need a little rest afore
tackling what’ll be a tough job. Five year ago I
war down in Taos visitin’ a half-breed who war related
ter Kit Carson. Ther cuss war weak-minded;
not a shore-ernuff fool, but mighty near ter one. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>hed been a member of a gang of desperadoes, Injun
an’ white, that had made things mighty hot fer ther
good people of ther Territory. Ther gang had been
broken up, an’ Manuel Larios, the half-breed, hed
saved his bacon by turnin’ State’s evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It war shortly arter ther trial that I visited him.
You wanter understand, Cody, that Manuel hed a
sister, an’ that I had a sneakin’ admiration fer ther
gal.” The big scout’s mouth twitched, and his eyes
sought the floor. “She’s dead now, an’ I—I, waal, I
thought a heap of her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill gave the speaker a glance charged with
sympathy and appreciation, and, recovering himself,
Angell went on composedly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Manuel war in bed when I hit ther adobe that sheltered
him. He talked a blue streak. War sure he war
goin’ ter peter, an’ wanted ter ease his mind. Among
other things, he reeled off a queer yarn erbout a cave
in these yere hills. A member of ther gang he had
been consortin’ with had found ther cave, an’ ther
gang fixed it up fer a hidin’ place. Thar war a couple
of mechanical critters in ther outlet, an’ they engineered
ther platform racket. I reckon one of ther Injuns
berlongin’ to ther gang war a Navaho, an’ that arter
the gang war scattered he let out what he knowed ter
Raven Feather. He couldn’t ha’ knowed ther hull
thing, or else ther part of ther cave we hev not yet
seen would ha’ been occerpied by ther reds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Manuel told me that only a few members of ther
gang, ther leader, Manuel, an’ two others, white men,
knew erbout the retreat beyond ther crevice. Ter prevent
the Injun contingent from gettin’ on to what war
intended fer ther treasure house of ther gang, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>leader an’ the few members he could trust worked ther
crevice as a scare hole. They knowed that ther redskins
would try ter investigate ther hole, an’ so they
rigged up a scarecrow, and rubbed phosphorious onto
it. The Injuns saw this scarecrow twice when they
were prospectin’ erbout ther crevice. That shore let
them out. They didn’t monkey with ther hole any
more. Now, all redskins are plumb eaten up with
superstition, an’ I reckon Raven Feather got hold of
ther tale, an’ so ther crevice had no attraction fer
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Raven Feather, who had not been gagged, here
gave a grunt of disgust and shame. “Me heap fool,”
he said, in English, to Angell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure,” was the quick response. “That aire p’int
war settled some time ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The scouts arose, and with the tomahawks taken
from the prisoners, proceeded to attack the crevice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their labor would have taken them many hours if,
after working a short time, they had not struck a ledge
of rotten rock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour after the telling of the story, Buffalo
Bill and his comrade were crawling upward out of
the chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been the hope of the king of scouts that he
would be able to follow the light that came through
the crevice and soon reach the top of the ground; but
the discovery that the light entered from above between
two massive bowlders, and that the open space
that separated him from the hilltop was not over half
a foot in diameter, put a damper on the hope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both he and Angell used their combined strength to
move the bowlders, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Come on,” said Angell, at last. “We will get outer
here, all right, though it’s shore goin’ ter take a little
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker was correct in his opinion. More than
three hours elapsed before they emerged from the new
section of the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond the bowlders there was a sharp descent. The
scouts went down, making many turns, and at last
stood in a chamber four times as large as the one that
had recently held them as prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>As they were exploring the place, Bart Angell, in
advance of Buffalo Bill, who held the torch, gave utterance
to a cry of amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ther sufferin’ saltpeter,” he exclaimed, “ef it ain’t
Manuel. Ther aire the chaps I guv him when he got
over his sick spell, an’ ’lowed he’d meander outer ther
Territory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked, and saw the body of a
man—that is, he saw a portion of the body. The head
and one shoulder was out of sight. The inference
was plain: The man had tried to crawl through a hole
in the wall, had become wedged in, and had died there.</p>

<p class='c007'>The torch was lowered so that a closer inspection of
the body might be made. The clothing had not rotted,
but from appearances Buffalo Bill knew that it inclosed
a skeleton.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you make of it?” inquired the king of
scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some one war chasin’ him, an’ he made fer ther
hole ter hide. It war too small, an’ he got stuck an’
stayed thar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what is down in that hole, Bart?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“You kin s’arch me. Maybe thar’s gold an’ all sorts
of plunder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how could the robbers have placed it there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Easy ernuff.” He gave the body a jerk, and the
opening was fully disclosed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it’s a large hole,” exclaimed Buffalo Bill, in
surprise. “I could go through it easily.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell chuckled. “Of course, Cody, of course.
An’ ye’ll have ter go through thar, fer it’s ther only
way outer this chamber.” As the expression of surprise
still lingered on the face of Buffalo Bill, Angell
quickly proceeded: “Manuel Larios war as broad as
he war long. Ye wouldn’t think it, lookin’ at him now.
I reckon every member of the gang, ’cept him, could
get through ther hole, an’ I reckon also that he’d never
tried ter crawl in ef he hadn’t been skeered plumb ter
death by whoever war pursuin’ him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe the pursuer caught up with him,”
was Buffalo Bill’s comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nor I. Bekase why? Ef he had, he’d shore hev
explored ther territory on t’other side of the hole.
Gimme ther torch, an’ I’ll try ther route.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Excuse me,” returned the king of scouts quietly,
“but I’ll have to disoblige you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, he flattened his body on the hard ground,
and, inserting his head in the hole, began to crawl
through it. He was at the other end, when an exclamation
of surprise escaped him. He was under an
overhanging wall, and the light of the torch permitted
him to see all about him. Below was what seemed
to be a bottomless pit, but his eyes were fixed not on
the pit, but upon a large recess in the wall upon one
side of him. This recess extended about six feet inward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and was about as wide as it was long. The
whole surface was covered with lime coating, and the
floor was strewn thickly with human bones. The hand
of the scout could have touched some of these bones,
and a close inspection induced the belief that they
had lain untouched for ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell was by Buffalo Bill’s side as the latter
said: “We’ve struck an Indian sepulcher. But how
in the name of the saints did the Indian bearers get the
bodies up here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gimme yer torch an’ I’ll tell yer,” replied Angell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill complied with his comrade’s request,
and the torch was lowered so that the wall of the
chasm could be plainly seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>A winding, dangerous descent was observed. At
the bottom was a pool of water, but the trail skirted
it and passed into a small, oval chamber. Angell
looked for some time at the trail, and then said: “We
kin make it, but we got ter be blamed keerful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke he started to go down. Buffalo Bill
waited until Angell was halfway to the pool, and then
followed carefully. In his hand was the tomahawk he
had used while working his way out of the Navahos’
cave. An idea came to him before he had taken half
a dozen steps. There would be a pursuit when Raven
Feather’s reënforcements arrived from the village.
Here was opportunity to stop the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trail had been made by human hands, footholds
having been cut in the rock.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his tomahawk the king of scouts destroyed
these safeguards as he passed them, and when he stood
by Bart Angell’s side at the foot of the descent, the
wall was without a trail.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“We can go on with more confidence now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Angell nodded, and they went through the chamber,
and after a long journey, in which many curious
sights were seen, they came out of the ground to find
that they were on the shore of a branch of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>The time was about midnight. The scouts were
both hungry and tired. They risked a small fire to
make coffee, a supply of which Buffalo Bill generally
carried with him, and, after partaking of the beverage
and the beef and hardtack that went with it, they were
ready for sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>If either had known just where he was there would
have been no sleep for their eyes that night. But they
had become confused as to direction on account of the
many turns they had made while in the great cave. To
attempt to find their bearings while the dark night
lasted might have taken them miles in a wrong direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>They were up at the break of day, and Buffalo Bill,
field glasses in hand, was scanning his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whar aire we?” asked Angell, as he raised his
arms in a yawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have been going westward. If I am not out of
my reckoning, we are about five miles from your
cabin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too bad. I’d been a-hopin’ we’d been p’intin’
t’other way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So had I, for the other way is the way the Navahos
will take, and that also is the way that villain
Holmes will take. I wonder if the redskins have overtaken
and killed him. If they have, pretty Myra Wilton
is now in the camp of the Navahos.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Thar’s nothin’ like findin’ out,” said Angell quickly,
“an’ I’m fer startin’ this identikle minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have a bite of breakfast and then start.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later the scouts were on the road to
the scene of their adventures of the day before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The platform that concealed the entrance to the cave
was reconnoitered, and when Buffalo Bill saw that it
had been shoved aside, leaving the shaft exposed, he
came to the conclusion that the Indians had abandoned
the underground retreat for good and all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both his horse and that of Angell had been stolen,
but on the trail to the cave he picked up a lariat that
had fallen from the saddle of one of the led animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the aid of the lariat he descended to the cave
over the protests of his comrade. “Ye’re shore takin’
a big chance, Cody,” Angell said. “Maybe ther reds
aire playin’ fox, an’, if they be, ye’ll get it in the neck
down thar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the king of scouts with a shake of the head went
down the rope. His voice was soon heard by the waiting
comrade above. “They’ve gone,” he shouted, “and
the girl has gone with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do ye know?” Bart Angell shouted back.
“Did she leave a billy dux?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts did not respond until he was on
terra firma again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She left her handkerchief, Bart. Put it where I
would be sure to see it. The hank wasn’t there when
we left the chamber.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>IN THE ENEMY’S CAMP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The two scouts left the cave and returned to Angell’s
cabin. Before moving against the enemy it was
necessary that their food supply should be replenished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bodies of the Navahos slain by Buffalo Bill had
been removed during the night, and the scout thought
it strange that the cabin had neither been robbed nor
burned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart,” said he, as they sat in the door and gazed
out upon the flat, “it’s my opinion that we won’t have
to hunt Raven Feather and his band. The chief left
the cabin intact believing that we would come back
here. Probably he did not expect we would get here
so soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whar is he now, do ye reckon?” inquired Angell.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In his village, but he has left a scout or two behind
to find where we are and report.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Them aire scouts must ha’ fell inter a hole or got
cold feet, Cody, else we should ha’ heerd or seen ’em.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of shots from down the flat stifled the
reply on Buffalo Bill’s lips. He jumped to his feet and
ran out into the open. Between the ruins of Matt
Holmes’ cabin and the ravine two horsemen could be
seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horses were standing still, and the backs of
the riders were turned toward the two scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill used his field glasses, and saw that the
horsemen were whites.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before he lowered the glasses the horsemen turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and rode up the flat. They waved their hands when
they caught sight of the king of scouts and his comrade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s face blushed with joyous excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bart,” said he, as he slapped his brave comrade on
the back, “do you recognize the tall one? It’s Wild
Bill.” Angell gave a whoop and threw his sombrero
high in air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The riders came up. One was a young, handsome,
honest-eyed man; the other was Wild Bill, the noted
Indian fighter and old comrade of the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Buffalo Bill was delighted at the meeting, what
must be said of the emotions of Hickok? Usually
cool, self-contained, slow in speech and rarely demonstrative,
he now exhibited the exuberance of an impressionable
youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drat my skin,” he exclaimed, after he wrung Buffalo
Bill’s hand and pulled him roughly but affectionately
about, “if I ain’t feeling too good for any use.
I expected to assist in a funeral, though I ought to
have known that you are too big a man to allow a
measly mob of Indians to down you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you hear? And how did you happen to
come here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me introduce my friend, and then I’ll saddle the
explaining racket onto him. This is Carl Henson, only
half a tenderfoot and wholly a thoroughbred. He
came from Denver to find you and somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill, with these words, moved toward the
cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on a bit,” said the king of scouts, his right
hand in that of the young man. “Before we go inside,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>I want some information. What did that shooting
down the flat mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh,” replied Wild Bill indifferently, “we just
stopped a little spying. A couple of Navahos were
sneaking toward this cabin when we spotted them.”
He said no more, and his head disappeared in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts winked at Bart Angell. Carl
Henson saw the wink, and said, with a smile: “Our
mutual friend Mr. Hickok is too modest. I had no
hand in the killing of the two Indians. But two shots
were fired, and both came from Mr. Hickok’s rifle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wild Bill shore shoots ter kill,” was Bart Angell’s
emphatic comment. “I’m a fair hand at their trigger
myself, but I lays down ter Wild Bill an’ Cody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cabin, Carl Henson told the story of his coming
to the flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My home is in Pennsylvania,” he began, “and I am
engaged to be married to the nicest girl in America.”
He sighed deeply, but went on before Buffalo Bill could
speak. “You have probably guessed her name, Mr.
Cody. It is Myra Wilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is a prisoner in the hands of the Navahos,”
said the king of scouts sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it, but”—his eyes flashing determinedly—“she
shall not be long a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon there are three persons in this room who
will back you up in that statement,” spoke Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s whatever,” responded Bart Angell quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill stroked his long, silky mustache. He
nodded, but did not speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you, gentlemen,” said Henson warmly. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>knew I could count on you. But to my story. I was
in New York when Miss Wilton left for the West.
She did not depart without informing me of the letter
she had from a lawyer, who represented that he was
the attorney for her uncle, Matt Holmes. I am myself
a lawyer, and it struck me when I considered the matter
that the letter was not genuine. I had heard of
Matt Holmes as an intelligent, shrewd, upright man.
It would not be likely for such a man to request the
presence of a young and inexperienced girl at his home
in the country of savage Indians, no matter what the
urgency.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I determined to follow her. I quickly arranged my
business, and arrived in Denver two weeks after she
had left her home. There I stumbled upon an important
piece of news. In the office of a lawyer friend of
mine, upon whom I had called for information concerning
my intended trip to these hills, I learned about
the death of Jared Holmes in Taos, and of the murder
of his brother, the miner, in the mountains of Colorado.
The lawyer was the attorney of the miner’s
estate, and he told me that there were two joint heirs,
the plainsman, Matt, and the Taos merchant, Jared.
In the event of the death of both, the estate was to go
to the next of kin, a nephew, Rixton, and a niece,
Myra.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Instantly I became alarmed. The letter received by
Myra was a lure; her death, as well as the death of
her Uncle Matt, had been plotted. There had already
been two murders, and the murderer and plotter must
be the nephew. I asked my friend if he knew Rixton
Holmes, and the reply was that he had met the nephew
once at the mine. ‘I did not like his looks,’ said he,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>‘and I believe, with you, that he is scheming to get
the whole of the property, which is very valuable.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The next day, when I was preparing to set out for
the New Mexican Mountains, my lawyer friend came
in. He was greatly excited. ‘It’s a cinch,’ said he, as
he dropped into a seat, ‘that Rixton Holmes is all we
have put him up to be. Last night a document came
to me by mail from New Mexico. It is the will of
Matt Holmes. I am named as executor, and he leaves
his property to Rixton Holmes and Myra Wilton,
nephew and niece. But there is a proviso. In the
event of the death of either, the share of the deceased
becomes the property of the Territory, and when converted
into cash is to be used in hunting down the murderer
of the testator. A letter was inclosed with the
will. It explained the meaning of the last clause of
the document. Matt Holmes has or had, for he is
dead, a bitter, relentless enemy, one Tom Darke.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop a minute,” said Buffalo Bill, as he passed a
thoughtful hand over his brow. “I want to straighten
something out. Rixton Holmes gave to Myra Wilton
a letter purporting to have been written by her uncle.
The letter refers to this will, and contains the same
explanation as your letter. I thought when the letter
was read to me that it was a forgery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friend’s letter was genuine,” said Henson.
“He had been doing business with Matt Holmes for
years, and could not be deceived by a forgery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon I was mistaken,” returned the king of
scouts, “but my error does not change the situation.
Rixton Holmes remains the villain and the murderer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was deep curiosity in Carl Henson’s expression.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I am very anxious to hear your story, Mr.
Cody,” he said, “and, therefore, I will hurry on with
mine. In the full belief that Rixton Holmes had written
the letter which induced Miss Wilton to leave her
home in Pennsylvania, that he meant to kill Matt
Holmes and then force the girl to marry him in order
that he might obtain possession of all the property, I
started for the Canadian River country. As I rode
away I could but admit that the villain had evolved a
cunning plot. He might be accused of the murders, but
there would be nothing but suspicion to urge against
him. It could be proved that the shot that killed Jared
Holmes in Taos was fired by Tom Darke, and the letter
of Matt Holmes to my friend in Denver, as well as
other circumstances, would seem to prove that the
miner brother met his death at the same hand. Tom
Darke had threatened to wipe out the whole Holmes
brood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe he did so threaten,” said Buffalo Bill, as
the young man paused, “but he was Rixton Holmes’
tool, all the same. I would give a good deal to know
how the two fiends came together. Rixton Holmes
must have been traveling under his Kansas alias when
they met, or there would have been no deal. Tom
Darke would have murdered his employer if he had
learned that the man was a Holmes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you are right, Mr. Cody. Well, there is
little more to tell; that is, for me to tell. My friend,
Mr. Hickok, must bring the explanation to a close.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill grunted, and Henson went on: “Two
days out I met Mr. Hickok. I did not know him, but
when he informed me that he was from Taos, and
was acting temporarily as a deputy United States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>marshal and was on the trail of a murderer known as
Lanky Tom Darke, I felt so pleased that I wanted to
hug him. We talked a while, and then I asked his
name. He blushed; yes, you did”—as the tall scout
shook his head vigorously—“and said he had a fool
name. Because he was the quietest individual in the
West the boys had derisively named him Wild Bill. I
gazed at him in amazement. Wild Bill! Who hasn’t
heard of him and who hasn’t heard of you, Mr. Cody?
I was fairly taken off my feet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll be really taken off your feet and deposited
in that ditch outside if you don’t let up,” spoke Wild
Bill sharply. “Quit monkeying with me and talk
sense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson smiled indulgently. “All right,” he
replied. “If I have given offense, I am glad of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell roared, and Wild Bill glared fiercely at
the young man.</p>

<p class='c007'>But presently he smiled, and began rolling a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We exchanged confidences,” proceeded Henson,
“and from that time on have been comrades. In the
hills two days later we came upon a wounded Mexican.
He had been shot by Raven Feather’s Indians and left
for dead. Why they did not scalp him is a mystery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No mystery at all,” grunted Wild Bill. “He was
bald-headed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So he was,” admitted Henson soberly, while the
others laughed. “That makes a difference, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say it did,” declared Buffalo Bill. “It’s
the hair the savages want.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I am glad the Mexican was not scalped, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the operation might have ended his life, and we would
not have learned then what the Navahos were up to.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Mexican was able to talk, and he told us that
he had overheard a conversation between Raven
Feather and a white man, who answered the description
of Rixton Holmes. A girl was to be abducted,
and her protector, Buffalo Bill, was to be killed. The
girl and you, Mr. Cody, had gone to a ranch in the
hills, a day’s journey from the spot. While the conversation
was going on another white man appeared,
and presently the two whites went off together. They
were mounted and rode westward. The second man
was Tom Darke, for the Mexican heard him called by
that name.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Afterward, while crawling away from the Indian
camp, the Mexican was seen and fired upon. He lay
as if dead, and had been there on the ground for two
days. Death came while he was talking to us. We
rode on, and—and here we are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Hickok, what have you to say?” asked Buffalo
Bill, as Henson finished his explanation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mighty little, old man. After we left the Mexican
we struck an Indian trail, and I parted company with
Mr. Henson to do a little scouting. I followed the
trail to the Indian village, and learned that there had
been a fight, and that Raven Feather had captured a
white girl. The chief was not in the village, but was
chasing a white man who had played traitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I returned to my friend here, and we concluded
to ride on to the flat and learn how things were there
before undertaking a campaign against the reds. You
see, Cody, I was a little anxious about you. I did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>know what had actually happened up here; and again,
there was that matter of Tom Darke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darke is dead, Hickok.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know. I saw the body. Must have been some
doing on and near this flat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill told what had occurred, and Wild Bill
opened his eyes in astonishment and admiration.
“Great Scott! But why wasn’t I here?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts eyed him coolly. “The fight
has but just begun,” he quietly remarked. “There is a
chance for you yet. There is a girl to be rescued and a
villain to catch and punish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tall scout arose, the flame of battle in his eyes.
“Come on,” he said. “I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So am I,” returned the king of scouts, “though I
would feel better if I had a horse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have one, so will Bart here,” said Wild Bill.
“The Indian scouts came here mounted. I saw them
when they left their plugs to make the sneak on the
flat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s eye kindled. He got up, and Bart Angell
and Carl Henson followed suit. The food wallets
were filled, and then the quartet went down the
flat, all walking, Wild Bill and the young lawyer leading
their animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the mouth of the ravine the bodies of the two
Indians slain by Wild Bill were found. The king of
scouts was surprised to discover that one of the Indians
was the giant Crow-killer. As he looked at the
motionless form of his late antagonist, a daring
scheme formulated in his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have done a big thing, Hickok,” he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>soberly to Wild Bill. “You have given me the chance
to get into the Navaho camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As how?” inquired the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As Crow-killer, the brother of Raven Feather.
Hold on, no expostulation until I have finished. The
dead Indian is of my height. He is a trifle heavier,
but that matter can be remedied by a little judicious
padding. You see that his face is one crisscross mass
of paint marks. I am never without Indian paint, and
it will be easy for me to make up my face so that it
will pass for Crow-killer’s, especially as I shall select
the nighttime for my entrance into the village.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may fool the mob, but you can’t pull the wool
over Raven Feather’s eyes,” said Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t have to. Leave that detail to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill knew that it would be useless to protest.
He said no more, but gave earnest attention to the
bold scheme that Buffalo Bill outlined.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mile from the flat the ponies of the slain Navahos
were found. The king of scouts took one and Bart
Angell appropriated the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trail to the village was a plain one, and the four
whites followed it until they arrived at the top of a
hill where there was a dense growth of trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below them, and not more than two miles away,
was the home of Raven Feather and his Navahos.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must not ride any farther,” commanded Buffalo
Bill. “There is probably a sentinel at the foot of
this hill, and there are others between the hill and the
village.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can see the fellow at the foot of the hill now,”
said Wild Bill, who had borrowed the king of scout’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>field glasses. “He is lying down under a tree and
smoking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was late afternoon. The horses were tethered,
and then the four friends sat down and waited for the
coming of dark. Each had a part to play, and each
was anxious for the time of action to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just before dark they had a cold meal, and when
night came Buffalo Bill arose, and, after shaking hands
with his three friends, strode boldly down the hill,
leading the larger of the two ponies, the one he had
selected, and which he believed to be the one that had
belonged to Crow-killer.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not signal his approach to the sentinel,
for he did not know what the signal was. But he had
devised a way of surmounting this difficulty. As he
came within hearing of the Navaho on guard, he began
the utterance of heavy groans, and followed them with
the motions of a person in a state of great bodily
weakness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentinel heard the groans, and, springing to his
feet, cocked his gun and waited for he knew not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon a staggering form was outlined between the
tree shadows.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentinel let out a hissing sound, followed by
the terrified squeak of a doomed squirrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, in his disguise, did not answer in kind.
He might make a mistake, and the mistake would be
a fatal one. Instead, he redoubled his groans, giving
to them the deeply guttural tones of the dead Crow-killer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentinel’s suspicions, if he had any, were dispelled.
He stepped forward, and said in Navaho:
“The great warrior of the Navahos, the brother of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>favorite of the Great Spirit, Raven Feather, is in pain.
Where is the pain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here.” The false Crow-killer placed his hand on
his heart, and at the same time began to cough violently.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentinel was within a few feet of the disguised
scout when his eyes fell on the horse. He started back,
and his gun was raised in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment Buffalo Bill was very near death.
In the confident belief that he had deceived the Indian,
he had not made any demonstration with his rifle,
which he carried loosely in his hand. He did not know
that the pony had betrayed him. But he realized in
a flash that the Indian had made an important discovery,
and he acted with the celerity of lightning.
But the Indian had the start, and a bullet would have
reached Buffalo Bill’s heart if a tomahawk, thrown
with a practiced hand, had not carved the Navaho’s
skull at the very moment when he was about to press
the trigger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts saw the Indian fall, and knew
that a friend had intervened, and in the nick of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill stepped from behind a tree. “I reckon
you’ll forgive me for disobeying instructions,” he said
in a whisper. “You see, I had a hunch that you’d
taken the wrong pony, and, knowing how the Navahos
regard such changes, I concluded to slip on behind you
and see you through.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are forgiven,” returned Buffalo Bill huskily.
“That’s another on me. I shan’t forget.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill looked closely at the pony. Before, while
on the way from the ravine, he paid no attention to
the animal.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“I am a fool,” he muttered, more to himself than to
his old comrade. “The two ponies the Indians—Crow-killer
and his partner—left behind when they sneaked
for the flat were pintos. This pony is a plain muser.
There was substitution after the Indians stole away
from their ponies. Some one, a white man, sure, for
on no other supposition can the conduct of this Navaho
at my feet be accounted for, exchanged his own pony
for that of Crow-killer. Why did he do it, and who
was he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rixton Holmes,” replied Buffalo Bill promptly.
“He knew the ponies. His own, this fellow, is a decent
sort of a plug, but Crow-killer’s is stronger and
fleeter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s it, sure, Cody.” Then Wild Bill added:
“Of course, you know the crook the Navahos have
about the horses of the whites.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes. They will never ride one. All that are
found are led away and killed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then don’t you see what a mistake you made in
riding this pony?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do, but it is only just now that the mistake has
been called to my notice. Confound it, I have got to
walk to the Indian village.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You needn’t walk. The other pony is right here
in the bushes. It is a pinto, and if it did not belong
to Crow-killer, you can explain, if you have to, that
your pony was killed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hickok, you are a friend, indeed. You have saved
me a lot of trouble and worry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts, on his new mount, parted from
Wild Bill and rode into the little valley of the Navahos.</p>

<p class='c007'>But his spirits were not buoyant. The mishap at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the beginning of his desperate venture had brought
many misgivings. But there was no hesitation as to
the program he had mapped out. He would carry out
his part no matter what the result might be.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was approaching the village, wondering, as he
rode, why he had not met another sentinel, when an
Indian arose from the deep grass along one side of the
trail and grasped the pony by the bridle, saying as he
did so: “Crow-killer must go back. It is the order
of his brother, the great chief, Raven Feather.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The disguised scout heard the statement with amazement
and disappointment. “What has Crow-killer
done that he should be treated in this way?” he indignantly
demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has offended Raven Feather. He has allowed
the white traitor to steal his pony.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the white traitor in the village?” asked the false
Crow-killer eagerly, forgetting his indignation for the
moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. But,” the Indian added, “he was seen before
the moon came, riding the pony of the chief’s brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s head sank to his breast. Nothing was
said for a minute. The scout broke the silence.
“Where must I go?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back to the flat of the white man who was killed.
There you must stay for two moons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do all the braves know that Crow-killer has fallen
from his high place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian shook his head. “But two know that
the pony of Crow-killer was stolen—Raven Feather,
the chief, and Red Antelope, who saw the white traitor
and the pony.” As he spoke, the Indian placed his
hand gravely over his heart. The king of scouts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>heaved a sigh of relief. The situation was not so bad,
after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Red Antelope,” he said, in the deep guttural of the
chief’s brother, “is a wise brave, a courageous brave.
He will do justice to Crow-killer. He will listen to
Crow-killer’s story, and he will not sustain the position
that Raven Feather has taken. Crow-killer was
wounded and unconscious when the pony was stolen.
The wound was not inflicted by the white traitor,
Holmes, but by the great white warrior, Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian shook his head. “The chief has given
his orders,” he said, “and Red Antelope must obey
them. Crow-killer must go back to the white man’s
flat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill dismounted. The time for talk had
passed. “Approach,” he commanded sternly, “and
gaze upon the wound that Crow-killer carries in his
breast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Navaho approached. He would look, he would
express his sympathy, and then he would see that the
chief’s order was carried out.</p>

<p class='c007'>When within arm’s length of the disguised scout,
his wrists were seized and he was hurled violently to
the ground. His cries were stifled, and he was soon
bound and gagged. The victory was an easy one, for
the Navaho was no match for his powerful and determined
antagonist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later Raven Feather, alone in his tepee,
was surprised by the entrance of one whom at first
glance he took for his brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was on his feet, his dark face burning with
anger, when a handful of red pepper was hurled at his
face. As he staggered back, he was thrown upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>couch of skins from which he had arisen, and a robe
was drawn tightly about his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after this occurrence the false Crow-killer
walked out of the tepee, and, accosting a Navaho,
said: “Raven Feather sleeps. Let him not be disturbed.
He has left his affairs in the hands of Crow-killer.
Where has the white maiden been placed?
Crow-killer must see her in order that he may report
when Raven Feather awakes from his sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer was like a blow in the face: “The white
maiden is dead.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>A CUNNING VILLAIN’S PLAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, the white maiden is dead,” repeated the Navaho.
“Did not Raven Feather so say to his brother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was speechless. The news was so astounding
that for the moment he was incapable of sustaining
his assumed character. As he stood staring at
the Navaho, there emerged from a tepee a few rods
below him a squat, grotesque figure, carrying a torch.
He was followed by three squaws, who set up a combined
wail as they came into the open air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The distraction was opportune for the greatly disturbed
king of scouts. It served to divert the attention
of the Navaho.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is the matter?” asked Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer was that the medicine man was on his
way to the tepee of the dead maiden to exorcise the
evil spirits which were struggling with the maiden’s
soul. Raven Feather had loved the white maiden, and,
as she could not become his squaw on this earth, he
wished her to become his spirit bride.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must be present,” said the disguised scout. “It
would be Raven Feather’s wish if he were awake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Raven Feather must be present himself,” replied
the Navaho. “Black Bison, the medicine man, cannot
drive away the evil spirits without the presence of
the chief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation was again becoming serious. The
Navaho would suspect the cheat if means were not
immediately taken to hoodwink him. Buffalo Bill
thought rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“I will go to the medicine man,” he said gravely,
“and tell him that Raven Feather, overcome by his
great sorrow, is sleeping. The mind of the chief was
distracted when he talked with Crow-killer. Raven
Feather forgot that Crow-killer did not know that the
white maiden had died; he forgot, also, that he had
promised to assist Black Bison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was lucky for the disguised scout that the Navaho
was of a low order of intelligence. The explanation
was accepted, and Buffalo Bill, immensely relieved,
strode toward the tepee into which the medicine man
and the squaws had just entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the way he passed a number of braves, who were
gazing curiously at the tepee of the proposed incantation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The false Crow-killer did not speak to any one of
them, but he did not fail to note with relief that they
looked at him without surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the door of the tepee he halted. The bearskin
flap had been pushed aside and secured so that a clear
view of the interior could be obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon a pile of skins in a corner lay the body of
Myra Wilton. Buffalo Bill could see the face, and a
chill came over his spirits. This, then, was the end of
his quest; this the termination of Carl Henson’s romance.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the feet of the body stood the dwarf medicine
man, and squatted on the floor in front of the body
were the squaws.</p>

<p class='c007'>The medicine man was muttering some strange
words, when the disguised scout uttered a low hiss.
The muttering quickly ceased, and Black Bison looked
up with a start. He saw the tall, muscular figure in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the doorway, and took note of the beckoning finger.
In an instant he was at the side of the false Crow-killer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lowering his head and speaking hoarsely, and just
above a whisper, the scout informed the medicine man
that Raven Feather was ill and could not come to the
tepee of death. But could not the chief’s brother,
Crow-killer, take the place of the chief? Crow-killer
was sure that the substitution could be made with success;
only, for Crow-killer had had a message from
the Great Spirit, the squaws must be sent away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Black Bison was filled with wonder. What had the
Great Spirit said to Crow-killer?</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had said,” solemnly announced the disguised
scout, “that the presence and assistance of Crow-killer
would be more potent than even the presence and assistance
of Raven Feather and the squaws. Why?
Because Crow-killer had just returned from an expedition
which had resulted in the killing of that dreaded
enemy of the Navahos, Buffalo Bill. The scalp of the
great white warrior was now reposing under the head
of Raven Feather, and when the chief awoke he would
find all his troubles gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The medicine man was deeply impressed. He
turned, issued a curt order, and the three squaws arose
and toddled out of the tepee.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had gone from sight, Buffalo Bill entered
the tepee and let down the door flap. He had
resolved upon a course that was not in his mind when
he entered the Indian village. If he could not rescue
Myra Wilton alive, he would carry her away dead.
The poor girl should not become the victim of an Indian
burial.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>He walked slowly to the side of Black Bison, and
then suddenly gripped the dwarf by the throat and
forced him to the floor. The head of the medicine
man struck the torch that he had brought, and which
had been stuck in a hole in the ground, and it fell over,
sputtered, and went out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quick change from light to darkness caused the
king of scouts to slightly relax his hold on the throat
of his victim. The action was instantly taken advantage
of, and Buffalo Bill, strong as he was, soon
discovered that he was opposing a very giant in
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>There ensued a long and terrific struggle, in which
not a word was uttered. While it was progressing, the
king of scouts thought he heard a movement from the
direction of the couch of skins upon which lay the body
of Myra Wilton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten minutes elapsed before the end of the contest
came. Sore and out of breath, Buffalo Bill got to his
feet and relighted the torch.</p>

<p class='c007'>As its light shone upon the bed of skins, he gave
vent to a cry of amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large slit in the skin wall back of the couch disclosed
the avenue of escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a strange light in his eyes the king of scouts
stepped quickly to the wall and examined the slit. It
had been made by one strong stroke. No weak woman
could have made it. Myra Wilton had not come to
life, but her body had been stolen by some enemy of
the Navahos.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of the hole in the wall went the wondering
scout, and with his sharp eyes endeavored to pierce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the darkness that surrounded him. There were no
lights in any of the other tepees. The nearest was
about twenty feet away, and standing in front of it
was an Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The false Crow-killer went over to the Navaho,
and was pleased to find that it was one who had spoken
to him concerning the medicine man and the incantation.
The Indian did not respond when asked if any
one had preceded the questioner out of the slit in the
tepee of the dead white maiden.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question was repeated. Now there was movement
instead of oral answer. Clutching the disguised
scout by the arms, the Navaho let out a yell that was
sufficient to arouse the whole village.</p>

<p class='c007'>A series of yells came in response, and as the king
of scouts flung the Indian to the ground he found
himself in the midst of an excited mob. He dodged
a tomahawk, caught sight of the vengeful face of
Raven Feather, fired point-blank at the chief’s head,
and, as the chief fell, struck right and left with weapon
and fist, and had succeeded in forcing his way out of
the crowd, when his legs were seized by the released
medicine man, who had crawled under the skin of the
tepee.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Buffalo Bill felt himself falling, a shout that was
as fine wine to a thirsty throat saluted his ears. Then
ensued a fusillade that sent all the Indians who could
use their legs to a place of security.</p>

<p class='c007'>The medicine man lay dead with a bullet in his brain
as the grateful king of scouts shook hands with Wild
Bill, Bart Angell, and Carl Henson.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had been awaiting the signal from Buffalo Bill,
and the delay in giving it had caused them to think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>that there had been a miscue. Consequently they had
entered the village on their own motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the ground where the shooting had taken place
lay seven Indians, among them Raven Feather, the
chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are not more than a dozen Navahos left,”
said the king of scouts as he looked at the slain, “and
I don’t think we need anticipate any trouble from
them. They know their chief is dead, and if we give
them opportunity they will leave the village before
morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shan’t object,” remarked Wild Bill. “I have no
use for them. Have you, Cody?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. We have won out in the Navaho matter.
But——” He paused, and gazed thoughtfully at the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what?” anxiously inquired Carl Henson. “Is
not Myra Wilton in the village? Haven’t you seen
her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The questions cost the sympathetic king of scouts
a painful effort to answer. But the truth must be
told. Slowly and gravely he narrated the story of
his adventures and discoveries since his arrival in
the village.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson uttered a groan of anguish. His form
shook with emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brace up,” said Wild Bill sullenly. “I have got
an idea, and if it doesn’t change your tune, then I don’t
know hardtack from chile con carne. Listen to me:
Myra Wilton is not dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson looked up with a start of joy. “Explain,”
he demanded. “What do you know that Mr.
Cody does not know?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“Mighty little in regard to most things, young man,
but a trifle more than he does in the matter of a certain
Rixton Holmes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think he stole the body, eh?” put in Buffalo
Bill. “So do I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course he is the thief. And I’ll bet a hat I
know how he worked the snap. When I was in Taos
gathering the facts about the murder of Jared Holmes,
I learned that Holmes—he went under another name
then—had been seen colleaguing with Tom Darke, the
man who did the actual killing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What of it?” broke in the agitated young man.
“How could this talk in Taos, months ago, refer to the
case of Myra Wilton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Easy, friend Henson,” returned Wild Bill amiably.
“Give me time and I’ll make the connection. I learned
something else. Rixton Holmes was a druggist in the
early part of his career. He worked at the business
in St. Louis; had to leave the town between two days
because he played a cunning fraud on an insurance
company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The four friends were now walking out of the village
toward the point where the horses had been stationed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill, without interruption, continued his statement.
“The case was a peculiar one. A woman, no
matter what her station in life was, had her life insured.
She was a friend of Rixton Holmes. A month
after the issuing of the policy she died; at least, that
was the opinion of the doctor who signed the death
certificate. The money was paid to Holmes, who was
named as the beneficiary. Six months later, the woman
turned up alive, and gave the snap away to the district
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>attorney. She wanted revenge. Holmes had agreed to
whack up, and he failed to do so. There was no
original intent to cheat her, but faro got the money,
and he simply couldn’t make good with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appears that the plot was concocted by Holmes,
who said he knew of a drug that, after being taken,
would produce the semblance of death, sufficient to
deceive an ordinary physician; and, by the way, it was
a very ordinary one who attended her in what was
supposed to be her last illness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I begin to see,” exclaimed Henson, as Wild Bill
paused and looked at the young man with a meaning
smile. “Holmes induced Myra to take the drug, and
when she was under its influence he stole into the
tepee and carried her off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re partly right and partly wrong,” replied
Wild Bill. “She took the drug, all right, but she did
not know that it came from her bitter enemy. Holmes
never saw her, and never gave the drug into her hands.
I believe she took the stuff in the belief that it came
from her friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill now had something to say. “I am inclined
to think that Hickok is right about the drug. I
now call to mind that there was a peculiar drug-store
odor about the tepee when I entered it. But Rixton
Holmes, as Hickok says, never personally induced the
girl to take the drug. There is mystery about that
part of the affair that won’t likely be solved until we
rescue Miss Wilton and catch the villain who carried
her off. It was a bold thing to do. The time selected
for the abduction was the best possible. By George!
I have it. Holmes followed us from the vicinity of
the flat. He must have seen us soon after he stole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Crow-killer’s pony, and, as his aim was to get the girl,
he followed us to the village, and permitted me to act
as his cat’s-paw, hang him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how did he get the drug to the girl?” asked
Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That gets me,” was the reply. “It must have
reached her some time before my arrival in the village,
for she was doing the dead act when I got there. Of
course, Holmes must have preceded me. We waited a
couple of hours, if you will remember, on the top of
the hill overlooking the valley.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” remarked Bart Angell, as he bit off a generous
chew from his side of hardcut, “we might as
well quit roominatin’ over ther case. What we got
ter do is ter git on ther track of Holmes, and that aire
mighty pronto.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can do nothing until morning,” said Henson
despondingly. “You can’t trail anybody in the nighttime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s true as a general proposition,” said Buffalo
Bill, “but in this case you’re off. The villain has a
pony, and, of course, the animal was staked near the
village. We can soon learn the direction of his flight.
There are three ways of leaving the valley. One is
toward the flat that we left behind this forenoon. The
second is through the cañon at the other end of the
village, a route that takes one to Colorado, and the
third is toward the east through a narrow pass, and on
to the plains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The horses of the party were found; and the fact
that they were where they had been left, near the trail
leading to the lower end of the valley and the western
hills, caused the king of scouts to believe that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Holmes had not sought to escape by way of the flat
and the ravine with the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he had come this way,” he said, “he would certainly
have spotted the ponies and stampeded them.
And I don’t think he took the trail at the other end.
He wants to reach the plains, and the way to get there
is by taking the eastern route.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then let’s investigate over that way first,” suggested
Wild Bill, “and if you’re right, as I believe you
are, we’ll be saving valuable time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had correctly sized up the fleeing villain’s
program. The tracks of a pony were found on
the east less than a mile from the village. There were
deep indentations in the soil, and the king of scouts,
looking at the marks, rightly concluded that they were
made by a pony that had carried double.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Holmes is a heavy man,” he remarked, “and Miss
Wilton isn’t exactly a lightweight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sleep was out of the question. The trail was followed
at night, though the progress was necessarily
slow. In the hills, where there was but one way for
a horse to take, they could make better time.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was daylight when they halted in a cañon, through
which flowed a deep and rapid stream of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had breakfast, attended to the wants of their
ponies, and then rode on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think Miss Wilton remained long in her
deathlike sleep?” asked Carl Henson of Buffalo Bill,
as the friends were riding, single file, up the steep side
of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If she revived before this, Holmes would have
found her more troublesome on his hands than an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>elephant would have been. He’ll not try to get her
out of her sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the sleep must some time come to an end.
When will that be? Have you any idea?”</p>

<p class='c007'>His anxiety was so marked that Wild Bill hastened
to say: “That woman in St. Louis stayed dead twenty-four
hours. It will take Holmes more than a day
to get clear of these hills. We’ll catch him before
he reaches the plains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just before noon Bart Angell, who was riding ahead,
and had just rounded a sharp turn in the trail, uttered
a shout that brought his companions quickly to the
spot where he had reined up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before him in the road lay the dead body of an
Indian pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a pinto, and it had been shot in the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill dismounted, and saw that one leg of the
animal was broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand,” he said. “The pony stepped in that
hole there, broke a leg, and was shot as an act of compassion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill, the man of coolness, threw up his sombrero.
“We’ve got him now,” he exclaimed. “That’s
as certain as death and taxes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts did not share in his old comrade’s
belief. “I don’t know about that,” he said
soberly. “Not having the pony, he will not be obliged
to keep to the trail. And it is so hard and rocky up
here that it will be no easy matter to trail him. However,
we will hope for the best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later Bart Angell, who had left the
trail at the request of Buffalo Bill, to explore a ravine
that debouched into the cañon upon the high side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>which they had been traveling, made a discovery that
raised the spirits of his comrades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The footprints of two persons had been found on a
short, sandy stretch, just below the mouth of a spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tracks pointed up the ravine, and it was clear
that retreat was being made in that direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no mistaking the prints. One set belonged
to a man, the other to a woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may ease your mind regarding one thing, Mr.
Henson,” said Buffalo Bill. “Miss Wilton has come
to her senses. She can walk, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man’s relief at this statement was not
pronounced. “But why is she going along with that
scoundrel?” he said, with a voice that had anger as
well as surprise in it. “He isn’t dragging her along.
She is stepping freely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you are not hobnobbing with the green monster,”
was the response, in comical disapproval.
“There is an explanation, and we are on the way to
get it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no trail that horses could follow, and so
the animals were left at the mouth of the ravine while
the three scouts and Carl Henson followed the footprints.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following was not easy; but the scouts were experts,
and though they went slowly over the rocky
ground, yet there was never a stop. Once they came
to a flat bowlder where it was evident that the girl
had rested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts believed that Holmes and Miss
Wilton were not far off, for he had felt of the carcass
of the pinto pony and found it warm.</p>

<p class='c007'>About a mile up the ravine the pursuers came to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>point where the ravine branched. One branch took a
direction at right angles with the course they had been
following. The direction was toward the west and
south, for they could see that half a mile up the branch
curved toward the cañon they had but recently left.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was both surprised and irritated when
the discovery was made that the tracks of the man and
girl turned into the western branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>A suspicion of the truth caused him to say to Wild
Bill and Bart Angell: “We may have been tricked.
It looks like it. Hickok, you and Bart will take the
back track to the place where we left our ponies. Henson
and I will follow these prints. They will take us
to the cañon trail, and we can all meet inside of an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The order was instantly obeyed. Wild Bill and Angell
hurried down the ravine. They reached the spot
where the ponies had been tethered to make the alarming
discovery that the animals were gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill looked at his comrade, and then each
began to use language that, while most expressive,
would not look well in print.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ebullition over, Angell ran to the cañon trail
and looked along the route eastward. “There they
are!” he shouted in wrath. “See ’em, Hickok? Most
to ther summit, an’ a-goin’ it fer keeps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill used his eyes and fiercely bit at his mustache.
“Each on a pony,” he muttered. “No coercion?
Going away like two elopers. Bart, this business
beats me to a frazzle. Got an opinion that is of
any value?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but I shore got a request ter make,” was the
response, in deep disgust. “Will you hev ther kindness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>as ter be so kind as ter take a squint among ther
big trees yereabout an’ find a knot hole. I shore desires
ter crawl inter it an’ haul ther hole in arter me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill fell to whistling. A smile came to his lips.
“I am waiting for Cody to come up. It will be worth
something to note the expression of his classic mug
when he sees what a mess we have made of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long before the king of scouts and Carl
Henson put in an appearance. There was no need to
look toward the spot where the ponies had been nor
to ask questions. The faces of Wild Bill and Bart
Angell told the whole crushing story.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment Buffalo Bill gazed at them without
speaking. Then he broke into a laugh. “Boys,” he
said, “it is certainly rough. But the battle is not yet
lost. Luck can’t stay always with that slick, double-dyed
villain. We are all candidates for bed, but the
bed has not been made that will take any of us in to-day.
It’s sprint, and as this is no time for a confab,
here goes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Up the hill he went, making surprising time for a
man of his weight. It may be said that his wound
had healed rapidly, and that for twenty-four hours it
had given him no concern.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill was the fleetest runner. Tall, thin, and
wiry, with the strength of a giant and the suppleness
of a panther, he fairly flew over the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson was a good second. The young man
was on his mettle. Besides, he had the greatest interest
at stake.</p>

<p class='c007'>For hours the fugitives were lost sight of, but in the
middle afternoon they were seen to descend a hill ending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in one of the rockiest sections of the Canadian
Mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his field glasses Buffalo Bill noticed that
Holmes and the girl were walking their ponies, and
that from time to time the villain, who was in the lead,
turned and shook his fist at the girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arrived at the foot of the hill, no attempt to increase
the speed of the ponies was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tell you what, boys,” said the king of scouts, in
pleasant excitement, “things are moving our way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean?” interrogated Henson eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, can’t you guess? We wouldn’t have come
in sight of Holmes if the ponies had not been walked
for a long distance. What has happened? Just this:
Miss Wilton has caught on to the situation. She has
refused to obey orders and ride hard. Holmes is mad
clear through, but can do nothing. He has probably
threatened to shoot her if she does not go with him,
but he can’t induce her to bring her pony out of a
walk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson was so greatly excited over what Buffalo
Bill had said that he started along the trail with
the speed of a race horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>If he kept on in his course, a few minutes would
bring him into view from the rocky basin through
which Holmes and Myra Wilton were riding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill shouted: “Come back, or you will spoil
all!” Henson heard, but he did not lessen his speed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts started after him. The pursuit
would have been fruitless if Henson, running with his
head in the air and his mind on the girl he loved, had
not stumbled over a large stone and pitched forward
on his face. The king of scouts picked the young man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>up to hear him say: “Let me alone. I am a match
for a dozen fellows like that one down there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t do as I say,” replied Buffalo Bill severely,
“you may lose the girl and be balked of your
revenge. Holmes is a man without scruple. Rather
than see Myra Wilton restored to her friends, he will
kill her even if his own life pays the forfeit. We must
go slow. The game is ours if we work it right. Leave
the direction of affairs to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Henson humbly. “I’ll not break
loose again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this conversation Holmes and his captive
halted, and the ponies were hobbled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was waiting for the darkness. He
might, with his force, descend immediately upon the
villain, but he feared that once the rescuers were seen,
Miss Wilton’s life would be in jeopardy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>SAVED FROM DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In a position from which all parts of the rocky basin
could be seen, Buffalo Bill assembled his men and
unfolded his program.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Holmes will not stay all night among the rocks
down there,” he said. “He may start on before dark,
though my opinion is that he won’t unless he should
see us coming down the hill toward him. He is probably
facing the hill now, on the watch for us. As he
will not get a glimpse of us during daylight, he will
conclude that we have not been able to make fast time
in the pursuit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish the darkness would hurry up and come,”
said Carl Henson, in fierce impatience. “I am worried
about Miss Wilton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She is in no present danger,” replied the scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was setting. Its rays illuminated and
brought into bold relief a long peak that stood at the
farther end of the basin. The peak was built of many-colored
rocks laid in belts, and the effect was grandly
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c007'>On one side of the peak ran the trail that led out of
the basin.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an hour the peak and the hollow at its base would
be wrapped in darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That peak seems to interest you, Cody,” said Wild
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It does, Hickok, for there I feel that the wind-up
will take place.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Then you don’t intend that Holmes shall sneak out
of the basin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have said it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I get the idea. The retreat by the peak must be
cut off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. The basin can be circled. There’ll be some
tough climbing to do, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But a man of my build can easily do the trick.
Good! That suits me down to the ground. Wish I
could start now. By gum”—looking along the irregular
wall of the basin—“I can start in daylight. The
rocks offer all kinds of opportunities for concealment.
What do you say, Cody? Hadn’t I better get a move
on right now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill did not answer at once. His eyes were
on the spot where Rixton Holmes and Myra Wilton
were resting. He saw the villain arise, take the girl
by the arm and point to the ponies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are going to move,” he said, in some excitement.
Then to Wild Bill: “Yes, you may go. You’ll
have to travel fast if you expect to get to the peak
before they come up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Trust me,” was the quiet reply, and Wild Bill was
off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson was so excited that he would have
rushed down the hill in spite of his promise to obey
Buffalo Bill’s orders, if Bart Angell had not caught
him by the arm and held him back. “Keep cool,
sonny,” was the big backwoodsman’s admonition.
“You’ll shore hev a chance ter take part in ther circus,
but you got ter remember that Buffalo Bill aire ther
ringmaster.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts, still watching the scene in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>basin, was both relieved and delighted to observe that
Holmes was having trouble with his captive. Myra
Wilton had refused to mount her pony. An angry
discussion was evidently taking place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, Wild Bill, active as a cat and with the
cunning and discretion that had so many times stood
him in good stead, was making quick time toward the
trail beyond the peak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once Myra Wilton turned and looked toward the
spot where Buffalo Bill and his two companions were
concealed. Did she know they were there?</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts was in doubt on this point, but
the inference was that Holmes believed that she suspected
help was near, for, while she was looking at
the point of concealment, the villain caught her around
the waist, lifted her from the ground, and, despite her
struggles, began to carry her in the direction of the
peak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, boys,” said Buffalo Bill, as he leaped to
his feet. “My slate is smashed. It’s now a case of
get there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When they reached the basin, Holmes and the girl
were out of sight. The huge rocks of the hollow hid
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as the objective point of the alarmed and desperate
villain must be the peak trail, the king of scouts
pressed forward, running as he never had run before.</p>

<p class='c007'>He outstripped his companions, and was in an open
space that permitted a view of the base of the peak
when he stopped in amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes was ascending the peak. Assisted
by the rocky rings, he had reached a point over fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>feet from the base. His strength must have been
prodigious, for he still held the girl in his arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was making no movement, and the king of
scouts believed that she had fainted. Had he known
that the brutal villain had choked her into unconsciousness,
his rage might have overlapped his judgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes saw Buffalo Bill, and stopped to draw a
knife from his belt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shoot, if you will,” he shouted hoarsely, “and I
will drive this knife into Myra Wilton’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You coward,” yelled Carl Henson, who had come
up and was beside himself with rage and anguish.
“Come down here and have it out with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Holmes laughed hoarsely. “I’m playing a safe
hand,” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do ye expect ter gain by this monkey business?”
demanded Bart Angell, who had his rifle
pointed at the villain’s head and was waiting for a
chance to fire. If the girl’s head had not rested against
the villain’s cheek he would have fired, anyhow. “I’m
not likely ter miss, but it won’t do ter take chances,”
he said sourly to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gain?” repeated Holmes. “Satisfaction, that’s
all.” His eyes were rolling wildly, and Buffalo Bill
realized that he was confronting a half-crazed enemy;
and he was the more dangerous on that account.</p>

<p class='c007'>But where was Wild Bill? He had had time to
reach the peak, and yet there was no sign of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the king of scouts wondered at the nonappearance
of his old comrade, Holmes, holding the knife
in a threatening attitude, backed out of sight, and continued
his ascent of the peak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill and his companions ran around the base
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to make a discovery that at the moment gave them
some satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain’s progress had been stopped. There
was a wide gap in the rings; too wide to be covered by
a leap.</p>

<p class='c007'>The path Holmes with his burden had been pursuing
terminated at a narrow shelf over an almost vertical
wall, which formed the back of a small cove cut out
of the base of the peak. The floor of the cove was
not smooth. Sharp, jagged sections of the rocky
ledge upon which the base rested pointed upward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rixton Holmes, standing perilously on the shelf,
looked down, and he gave a wild laugh as his eyes fell
on the king of scouts, Bart Angell, and Carl Henson.
“The jig is up,” he shrieked. “Myra Wilton is going
into eternity, and I am going to follow her. I lose and
you don’t win.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to fire,” said Henson in a husky whisper.
“I—I can’t stand this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait,” sternly commanded Buffalo Bill. “If there
is any shooting to be done, it must be done by me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he ceased speaking, Holmes raised the limp form
of the girl above his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Down she goes,” he yelled, and, dazed with horror,
Carl Henson started back, his rifle held in a nerveless
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a frightful moment. Buffalo Bill, whose wits
had not deserted him, did not fire, though he might
have done so. He realized that a shot would not save
the life of the girl, for her form was held directly over
the precipice, and that she would fall the instant a bullet
entered the brain of the fiend who held her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Therefore, instead of firing, he leaped into the cove,
braced himself, and raised his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>There came a savage shout from above, and the next
instant the villain fell back on the ringing rocks with
Wild Bill on top of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The intent of the tall scout had been good, but it did
not suffice to bring the girl from a position of deadly
danger to one of safety.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sudden descent of Wild Bill from above the
shelf caused Holmes to relax his grip on the form of
his victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her senses had returned a moment before Holmes
lifted her above his head. As the villain fell over
under the weight of the savagely excited scout, she
slipped over the edge of the precipice.</p>

<p class='c007'>But she did not fall to the bottom. She clutched
at the uneven surface of the side wall as she went,
and halfway down her belt caught on a projection, and
she hung there, head and feet pointing downward.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her terrified eyes met the upturned gaze of the palefaced
king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Raise yourself if you can,” he shouted encouragingly,
“and grip that rock that has caught you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The attempt was made and was a failure. The girl
was too weak to exert more than a small portion of
her normal strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rest a bit and try again,” counseled the scout. “If
you can hold on a few minutes, I’ll get you onto solid
ground.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t I do something?” said Carl Henson, his
handsome face twitching with agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” was the quick response; “you can run to the
ponies, where Holmes left them, and get the reatas.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>The young man was off like a shot, but he never
went as far as the spot where the ponies had been
secured. On his way he met Bart Angell. The big
backwoodsman had the reatas in his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckoned as how they’d shore be needed,” he said
to Henson, “an’ so I jest naterally made a bee line
fer ther ponies without axin’ Cody’s permission.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Henson and Angell reached the cove Myra
Wilton had succeeded in gettin’ her hands on the rocky
projection, and Wild Bill was standing on the narrow
shelf above.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hike up here with those reatas,” Wild Bill shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll take them,” said Carl Henson quickly. “I can
make better time than you, Mr. Angell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill would not leave his position under the
girl. She might fall at any moment. If she did, it
might be death for him and her, for there was a sheer
drop of nearly fifty feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell regarded the king of scouts gravely.
Soon he was standing behind his comrade. “Go away,
Bart,” commanded Buffalo Bill. “One is enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe not, son,” was the firm reply. “If she
comes, I’ll shore yank you back ther minute she strikes
your arms. Thataway we’ll save some of ther pieces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts tried to smile, but could not.
Above him the girl was swaying about the projection
that was holding her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t hold on much longer,” she said faintly, and
her voice just reached the ears of the king of scouts.
“And if I let go with my hands I must fall, for the
belt has given way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must hold on,” came the reply as a command.
“Help is on the way.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>A shout from the shelf gave her courage. “I am
here, Myra,” called out Carl Henson tremulously. “I
have got ropes, and they’ll be down to you in a minute.”
While he was speaking Wild Bill was twisting
the reatas. In the cove Buffalo Bill breathed a sigh of
deepest relief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The transition from torturing suspense to ardent
hope was scarcely set before Bart Angell screamed:
“Look out, she is falling!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke the awful truth. Myra Wilton, turning to
look up at her lover, had broken off the end of projection
of rock about which her hands were clasped. If
she had had wits about her she might have saved herself
from falling, but the accident unnerved her, and
she relaxed her hold on the solid, fixed, remaining section
of the rock.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Henson saw her fall, and would have leaped
after her if Wild Bill had not seized his arm in the nick
of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young man was struggling in the grasp of the
tall scout, when a joyous shout from the cove caused
him to gaze into Wild Bill’s face in utter bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A miracle, I reckon,” said the scout to the young
man as they both started for the shelf.</p>

<p class='c007'>And a miracle, or something closely allied to one,
had intervened to save the life of Myra Wilton. Her
lover, looking down, saw her safe in the arms of Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had not fallen straight from the projecting rock.
There were other projections on the side wall of the
cove. She had caught at them as she went down, and
once her gown had held her up for a few seconds.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>When at last she fell, to be received in the arms of
the king of scouts, she was not more than ten feet from
the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five minutes later she was clasped to the breast
of Carl Henson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mighty close shave, Cody,” remarked Wild Bill,
as he slapped his old comrade on the back; “mighty
close. I never expected to see either you or her alive
again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was sitting on a rock mopping his face.
He was about to make some sort of response, when
Myra Wilton left her lover and stood in front of him.
First she smiled, and then impulsively leaned over
and kissed him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The debt is wiped out,” he said, as he took her two
hands and pressed them. “But”—he paused and
smiled at Carl Henson—“you must let me dance at
your wedding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You shall,” she responded, with a pretty blush.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts now gave his mind to more
serious concerns. “How is it with Rixton Holmes?”
he asked Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a case of dying, Cody. The fellow struck his
cabesa on a sharp rock when he fell, and the point
became acquainted with his Sarah Billium.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can he talk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t know. I’ll bring him down for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bart Angell went with Wild Bill. They soon returned
bearing the limp form of the villainous cousin
of Myra Wilton.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wound was bandaged, and whisky was forced
down his throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon he opened his eyes and stared about him. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>saw the girl he had tried to murder, and he looked
into the sober, reproachful countenance of the king
of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take the money,” he said faintly, and trying to
conjure up a smile. “I’ve lost.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was asked to make a full confession of his
crimes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Life is too short for that,” he replied, “but I’ll tell
something about the mine affair. I would never have
plotted to kill my three uncles if I hadn’t bumped up
against Tom Darke. He knew me as Rixton Clay,
and had no notion that I was related to the Holmeses.
We became card partners, and soon I knew all his secrets.
One night when he was pretty full he told me
that he had come West for the purpose of killing three
men—Peter, Jared, and Matt Holmes. At that time
Peter’s mine was the talk of Colorado. There had
been a rich discovery, and the mine was worth millions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I reflected, and soon the plot was born. Tom
Darke killed Peter and Jared, and he would have
killed Matt if I had not taken the job off his hands. I
had to, for I was afraid that Darke’s gun would miss
fire and that Matt would get him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The letter that brought my Cousin Myra to New
Mexico was written by me. I had ingratiated myself
with my Uncle Matt, and I knew he had made a will,
leaving his estate to me and Myra. His estate then
did not amount to much, but the estate of Peter did,
and when Peter and Jared died, Matt became the owner
of the mine. Before Myra arrived, Peter and Jared
had crossed the divide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I could have come forward and claimed half the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>estate when my three uncles were dead, but I was
afraid that I would be arrested. Although I had covered
my tracks pretty well, I dared not face the authorities.
Therefore, my scheme at the last was to marry
Myra, compel her to give me the larger part of her
share, and then light out for foreign parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe she was on the point of trusting me, when
you, Mr. Cody, was trapped in the cave. But I found
when we got outside the hole that I had caught a Tartar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His voice became so weak that it could scarcely be
heard. More whisky was administered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is not much more for me to say,” the dying
villain proceeded. “I stole Crow-killer’s pony and
trailed you and your friends, Mr. Cody, to the Indian
valley. I guessed your object. You were on your way
to rescue my cousin from the hands of the Navahos.
I determined to block that game if I could. I sneaked
into the village ahead of you, and just after dark got
to Myra’s tepee, and was lucky enough to find that no
one was with her. I was once a druggist, and I have
always carried on my person a powerful and peculiarly
acting drug that was sent to me from the East Indies.
This drug will produce a sleep that resembles death.
I had come to the tepee prepared to work a bold design,
and before I crawled away the drug was in the
hands of Myra, and she knew what to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you deceive her,” asked Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I used your name. A note accompanied the vial
that contained the drug. The note was signed with
your name, and informed her that you were near by,
and that her rescue was certain if she would comply
with your wish. She must swallow the contents of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>vial. A deep sleep would come, the Indians would
look upon her as dead, vigilance would be relaxed,
and she could be carried away before daybreak. I did
not, of course, enter the tepee, but thrust my hand
under the wall of skins and made a slight noise to attract
her attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The scheme worked better than I had planned.
The rescue was made with you, Mr. Cody, as my ally.
The fight in the tepee was right to my hand. Before it
was over I was on my pony, with Myra in my arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I used her roughly after she came to her senses,
it was because I was half insane with fear. You were
in pursuit, I knew it, and I knew, also, that I was
doomed unless I got safely out of the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did Miss Wilton see me before you left the pony
to run to the peak?” asked Buffalo Bill. “She acted
as if she did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, she did not see you, but she made me believe
she did. Then I must have gone wholly insane. I
determined to kill her and then kill myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tale was told. In a few minutes Rixton Holmes
was dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not many weeks later Myra Wilton and Carl Henson
were married in Denver. Wild Bill Hickok left
his partner to engage in a hunting expedition on the
Continental Divide. Buffalo Bill, however, had much
else to attend to. He had scarcely finished his work
in the Holmes murder mystery before he had received
a telegram from Colonel Hayden, an army officer, requesting
the aid of the king of scouts in locating his
beautiful daughter, who had been kidnaped by a notorious
bandit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>A MAN HUNT IN ARIZONA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“He does not look as if he had the intelligence of a
rabbit, Cody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker’s fine face was shadowed with grief.
The tone was despondent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll admit that he would not likely pull a prize at
a scholastic exhibition, colonel; but he knows one
thing, and he knows it well. It may be instinct or it
may be intelligence—I’ll not venture a decided opinion
on the point—but the proof is abundant that he
is, par excellence, the great and only human sleuthhound.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, mounted on a coal-black steed, smiled
on the Hualapi, who was the subject of Colonel Hayden’s
remark.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian was short, squatty, and in features
closely resembled the despised Digger of northern California.
The forehead was low, the nose short and
broad, the lips as thick as a negro’s, and the chin conspicuously
nonaggressive. The eyes were small, piercing,
and snaky. Fixed upon the colonel, they expressed
utter disdain, for the Hualapi could speak a fair sort
of English, and he had understood the purport of the
colonel’s slurring statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three men, the whites on horseback, the Indian
on foot, were on the edge of the Colorado desert.
They looked upon a sky unbroken by a cloud. The
horizon stretched away until, on either side, it was lost
in the haze of quivering heat. The expanse was unmarred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>by tree or shrub, while underfoot a sea of
restless sand, ever shifting and ever changing, seemed
as if it sought to escape the all-pervading, deathlike
monotony and silence of the desert.</p>

<p class='c007'>Add to this the sparse and stunted vegetation that
tells of scanty water and burning suns, and a picture
is presented of the home of the Hualapi, the human
sleuthhound, who by the keenness of his vision follows
the trail of man or beast where the best bloodhound
would be baffled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Day after day the scene is the same, until the eye,
weary with sweeping the unbroken wastes, contents
itself with noting the few signs of life the desert
furnishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden tried to gather comfort from the
confident assertion of the king of scouts. But his almost
hopeless look returned when he gazed out upon
the desert.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill regarded the serious-faced officer with
an eye of pity. The colonel’s mind was burdened with
a deep sorrow and a racking anxiety. He was a father,
and his only child, a daughter, was in the power of a
conscienceless villain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Commander of a military post in Wyoming, he had
obtained leave of absence for the purpose of pursuing
the abductor of his daughter. Buffalo Bill, then in
the government employ, had also secured leave on the
recommendation and at the urgent request of the colonel,
who believed that if any man in the West could
trail the villain and rescue the girl, the brave, fearless,
and skillful king of scouts was that man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The abduction had not the usual sordid motive.
Colonel Hayden was a rich man, but there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>question of ransom in the carrying away of Sybil Hayden.
Nor was there anything between the colonel and
Edward Frams, better known as Black-face Ned, out
of which hate and revenge might have grown. The
two men were strangers. Colonel Hayden did not
know that such a person as Black-face Ned existed
until the terrible news of the abduction reached him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sybil was away from the post visiting a schoolmate
at her mountain home many miles from the military
station when she met the villain who now had her in
his power.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a cowboy, and had arrived at the ranch a
few days after Sybil made her appearance there. Tall,
muscularly built, with flashing black eyes, a pale, classic
face, and a heavy, drooping mustache, he was a man
who always attracted attention and compelled admiration.
He was vain of his good looks, and believed
himself to be a lady-killer of the first water. Sybil
Hayden thought him interesting, but she did not admire
him. There was something about him that induced
distrust. His eyes had frequently a sinister
gleam in them, and when he looked at her she saw
more than he desired she should see.</p>

<p class='c007'>None of the other cowboys on the ranch knew him,
and none of them grew to like him. They were rough,
honest fellows, and did not take kindly to his style,
which was dandified and superior. But they grudgingly
admitted that he knew his business. He was a
fine rider and a dead shot, and his bravery was unquestioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>His story was that he had just come from northern
Mexico, where for ten years he had been the foreman
of a large cattle ranch.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>One day while Sybil was riding a few miles from
the house she met Frams, who was returning from a
visit to the nearest town.</p>

<p class='c007'>She gave him a cool bow, and was about to ride on,
when he reined up by her side and spoke quickly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must say what I have been wanting to say for
weeks, Miss Hayden. You must hear me. I love you,
and I want you for my wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl’s indignation was greater than her surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing to say to you,” she replied coldly.
She gave her pony a light tap, but Frams caught the
bridle, and the pony remained at a standstill.</p>

<p class='c007'>His voice was hoarse as he said: “You look upon
me with contempt because I am poor. I know your
kind, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Like them.” The interruption was coolly made.
Frams turned red, and his eyes glittered savagely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I like your kind,” he hissed, “though I despise
them, also.” Irritated by her cool, sneering expression,
he continued fiercely: “I love you, and I
want to tame you, to bring you down from your high
horse and make you sing small for your attitude toward
those you consider your inferiors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You make love in a most peculiar way,” Sybil replied,
with a smile that made the villain grit his teeth.
“Until to-day I was scarcely aware that you existed.
But your stupendous insolence has forced you upon
my notice. Be kind enough to remove your hand from
the bridle. If you were a gentleman, I would not
have to ask twice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With an oath, Frams let his hand fall to his side.
As the girl rode on, he shook his fist at her and said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>loud enough for her to hear: “Go on, but don’t think
you have done with me. A day of reckoning is coming.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On her return to the ranch house, Sybil did not mention
her meeting with Edward Frams. She believed
that the incident was closed, and that the cowboy would
in future keep his distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not ill pleased when at night Frams threw
up his job, received his money, mounted his pony, and
rode away, declaring that he was going back to Mexico.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two nights afterward, Sybil, who slept in a room
on the first floor, with window opening on the long
veranda, was awakened from a sound sleep by a noise
near her couch. Before she could cry out, a handkerchief,
saturated with chloroform, was pressed
against her nostrils, and her senses left her. When she
returned to consciousness, she found herself strapped
to the back of a horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was still dark, and the horse was going at a gallop
along the trail toward the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>In front was another horse, and upon its back, a
cruel smile upon his dark face, was Edward Frams,
the cowboy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day the news of the abduction reached
Colonel Hayden. Well-nigh distracted, he reached
the ranch at the earliest possible moment, and learned
that several parties were out in pursuit of the abductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The animal Frams bestrode had peculiar hoof marks,
and several of the cowboys at once recognized them.</p>

<p class='c007'>A week went by and there was no report from any
one of the pursuing parties. Colonel Hayden had
come too late to hope to overtake the men who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>gone on the trail of Frams, and so he remained at the
ranch in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p class='c007'>While awaiting news, he telegraphed a description
of the abductor to the officers of all the towns, north,
south, and west, and after the lapse of several days
received a letter from the Denver chief of police, stating
that the description fitted one of the most daring
and conscienceless scoundrels in the West, one whose
whereabouts had been unknown for many years.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had been the leader of a gang of outlaws whose
range of operations extended from Mexico to Dakota.
Five years before the gang had been broken up, but
Black-face Ned and three of his men had escaped and
gone south toward Mexico.</p>

<p class='c007'>This intelligence increased Colonel Hayden’s alarm.
He chafed at the suspense, and would have taken the
field himself if the members of one of the pursuing
parties had not returned ten days after setting out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leader reported that the trail had been followed
into Colorado, and there lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon afterward the other pursuers returned. They
had failed to trace the abductor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden obtained leave of absence from the
government, had Buffalo Bill detailed to assist him,
and a month after the abduction they stood on the edge
of the Colorado desert, the king of scouts having
picked up the trail the cowboys had lost, and followed
it to the desert. Here the services of the Hualapi had
been secured on the strong recommendation of Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was early morning when the little party, with the
Indian in the lead, took their way across the desert.
An expert reader of signs, the Hualapi was soon able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>to announce that the trail was but one day old. There
were many indications—among them the dew that had
fallen, the dust or sand that had drifted into the track,
the condition of the occasional tufts of dry grass which
had been pressed underfoot and had partially regained
upright shape, and minute marks upon the rocks—that
told a plain story to the trailer.</p>

<p class='c007'>After traveling slowly for a mile, the Indian
stopped, straightened himself, and looked knowingly
at the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill rode forward and asked: “What is it,
Panecho?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sacks on feet; heap smart trick, ugh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The grunt of contempt caused the scout to smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Meant to fool the ordinary white man, but it
doesn’t fool you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian nodded. He had been following a very
faint trail made by two horses whose feet had been
muffled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bimeby sacks come off,” Panecho said. “Then we
go fast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the trailer went, and late in the afternoon reached
a spur of the Hualapi Mountains. Ten minutes later
the Indian held up his hand. He had lost the trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden uttered a sigh of acute disappointment.
Buffalo Bill looked at the officer, half in contempt,
half in pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lost for the moment,” he said; “but Panecho will
soon pick it up again, or I’ll miss my guess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian made a motion that the king of scouts
understood. A triangle was formed, the point where
the last vestige of the trail had been seen being in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>center of the base. Moving from each of the three
points, the colonel, Buffalo Bill, and the Hualapi began
a search for the missing trail. The colonel, who had
watched the Indian closely during the ride across the
desert, and whose eyes were sharpened by anxiety,
was the one who found it. The mark was small, and
so faint that the officer had to look twice to be sure
of it. He did not shout his discovery, for silence was
the order of the day, but motioned with his hand.
The Indian ran up, looked at the mark, and then hurried
on, to soon find another mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the pursuit was resumed, and when an hour before
dark a point was reached, where there were evidences
that the sacks had been discarded, the colonel
was in a state of hopeful excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>There upon the ground was the impress of a horse’s
hoof. The trail now became more distinct, and the
Indian went forward with a celerity that delighted
while it astonished the colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>At dark a halt was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pursuers were now at the mouth of a narrow
pass. Nothing could be done until next morning, for
Buffalo Bill knew that to try to follow the trail by
lantern light would not only be slow and vexatious
work, but might be attended with grave danger. If
Black-face Ned was near at hand, and he might be, the
light would give him opportunity to pot every one of
the pursuers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Camp was made, and after a cold supper the two
white men and the Hualapi found soft places, and
stretched themselves out for a few hours’ much-needed
rest. Buffalo Bill was up before daybreak. He roused
the Indian, and then turned to walk toward the spot—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>lee of a bowlder—where the colonel had lain, and
was amazed to discover that the soldier had gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both the king of scouts and the Hualapi were light
sleepers, and it seemed strange that the colonel should
have departed without awakening either of them. Not
far away from the camp was a small creek, and, in the
hope that the colonel had gone to the water for a
drink, Buffalo Bill went down the sloping bank, and
soon stood on the water’s edge. It was now light
enough for the scout to see for some distance about
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no sign of Colonel Hayden anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the king of scouts stood and wondered, the
Hualapi came to his side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Him heap make sneak,” said the Indian, with many
nods. “Go away, think he catch bad man asleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He must have crawled off noiselessly, so as not to
disturb us,” replied Bill irritably. “I shall have to
give him a sharp lecture when he comes back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Him heap fool, may spoil game,” said the Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words had scarcely left the Hualapi’s mouth before
there came a sharp report, and a rifle bullet ended
the speaker’s career.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick upon the shot Buffalo Bill dropped to the
ground. The move saved the scout’s life, for a second
report had followed the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had dropped near the trunk of a large
cottonwood. He was behind it in a twinkling, and
with pistol in hand—he had left his rifle at the camp—awaited
the next move of the assassin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five minutes passed and not a sound broke the stillness.
The enemy must be still on the spot whence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>shots had been fired. If he had moved, the king of
scouts must have assuredly have heard him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is waiting for full daylight,” was the scout’s
conclusion. “Well, so am I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Back of Buffalo Bill was the creek, and across the
creek was a wall of rock that rose sheer to a height
of one hundred feet. There was, therefore, no danger
of an attack from behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>But one side of the scout’s place of shelter was exposed,
that which looked toward the camp. The other
side was a mass of high, thick brush.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the expiration of ten minutes, the silence having
continued unbroken, Buffalo Bill stooped, picked up a
three-foot section of the dead branch of a tree, and
then removed his sombrero. Placing the hat at an end
of the stick, he thrust it a few inches beyond the cottonwood
in the direction of camp. No shot followed.
Either the ruse was guessed, or the enemy had changed
his position.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation was a ticklish one. If the scout
stepped out into the open space he might become a
target for a murderous bullet, while if he crawled into
the brush he might encounter a similar danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where had the enemy gone? Buffalo Bill tried to
put himself in the unknown’s place. After a few moments’
thought, he said to himself: “He has probably
sneaked noiselessly to a point nearer the camp.
He has seen the rifle, and he believes that I will, after
a time, return there. I will return, but not in the way
he expects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was but the space of a few yards between the
tree and the creek, which carried a deep and swiftly
running body of water.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Buffalo Bill flattened himself, crawled in safety to
the water, and then softly entered it. Keeping his
head as low as was possible, he allowed the strong
current to carry him a quarter of a mile. Then he
swam to shore, mounted the bank, and halted at the
trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Full daylight had come, and the scout could almost
see the camp from where he stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The way thither was along a rock-bordered path,
with here and there a tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill looked at the trail, shook his head, and
then turned his eyes up the bank of the cañon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the trees were more numerous, and there were
many bowlders, and a few flat places where the mesquite
flourished.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts, without hesitation, went up the
bank, and by stooping and crawling managed to reach
a spot above and not twenty yards from the camp without
having been seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could see the rifles, and knew by this that the
enemy had not as yet entered the camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the scout did not move from his place of concealment.
He had a shrewd idea of the situation, and
was not surprised when, after a short time, he heard a
noise in the brush below him and close to the camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently a tall, muscular Indian stepped into the
open and moved toward the rifles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, who had expected to see Black-face
Ned, was astonished and puzzled when the redskin, an
Apache, stepped into view.</p>

<p class='c007'>A bullet from the scout’s pistol would have laid
the Indian low, but Buffalo Bill did not desire to fire
the shot if the action could with safety be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“I’ll capture him, if I can, and make him tell me
what brought him here, and why he killed the Hualapi.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this thought in his mind, Buffalo Bill watched
the Apache until he saw the Indian stoop to gather up
the rifles. Then he rushed down the bank with such
speed that he was close to the Apache when that astonished
aborigine raised his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next moment the scout’s fist shot out with catapultic
power, and the Indian measured his length on
the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blows were rained on the victim’s head until he was
reduced to a state of insensibility.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SCOUT CAPTURED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buffalo Bill did not remain by the side of his victim
and await the return of sense. He made practical use
of his time. He ate his breakfast, risking a small fire
for coffee.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was eating, the Apache opened his eyes.
For some time he regarded the placid-faced king of
scouts with a deeply malevolent expression. But when
he spoke in the tongue of his tribe, the expression had
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Coffee for the great white warrior, cold water for
Thunder Cloud.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill started, then looked at the Apache
keenly. “So you are the renowned Thunder Cloud,
are you?” he inquired in the Indian language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache nodded, and there was pride in his look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A chief,” the king of scouts went on reproachfully,
“who stoops to the work of the slinking, murderous
brave. Thunder Cloud has forfeited the respect
of his foes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian’s eyes blazed with anger. “The great
white warrior speaks without thought. Thunder
Cloud was whipped like a dog by the white captain,
and now he is a chief without a tribe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I heard of that whipping,” returned the king
of scouts cuttingly. “Thunder Cloud broke his parole,
and Captain Foster punished him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian gnashed his teeth in savage recollection
of the action which had disgraced him in the eyes
of the Americans.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>There was silence for a few moments. Buffalo Bill
broke it by asking: “Would the chief like a cup of
coffee?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” was the quick answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coffee was drunk, and then the king of scouts,
believing the Indian to be in a fairly quiet frame of
mind, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did the chief kill Panecho, the Hualapi?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud frowned. He did not answer the
question.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was repeated, and with sternness. The Apache
noted the menacing expression in the scout’s eyes, and
mumbled something about an old feud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are dodging the issue, Thunder Cloud,” said
Buffalo Bill sharply. “I must know the truth. You
are in my power. Why should I not kill you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian shut his lips tightly. He was a stoic.
“Why not?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts took a new tack. “What if I
take you to the village of the Hualapis and deliver
you over to the brothers of Panecho?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud shivered. “No, no,” he entreated.
“Let the great white warrior take his revenge.
Thunder Cloud is content to die by the hand of Buffalo
Bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts appeared to seriously consider
the matter. “I’ll tell you what I will do,” he said,
after a pause. “I will deal with you myself, if you,
on your part, will tell me what made you shoot
Panecho, and why you are in my camp, a spy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache, who was without honor, and who
would have betrayed his best friend if he saw a chance
of personal profit, promptly replied: “Thunder Cloud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>killed Panecho because the Hualapi was hot on the
trail of Thunder Cloud’s friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just as I supposed,” remarked Buffalo Bill quietly.
“You have hired yourself out to that white villain,
Black-face Ned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud nodded, and then in answer to another
question said that Colonel Hayden had been overcome
while he was walking along the trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill guessed how the colonel had been
caught. He had arisen early and had gone down the
cañon, hoping to come upon the camp of the abductor
of his daughter before the coming of daylight. On
the way he had been attacked by a sentinel posted by
the white outlaw, and was now in the power of the
man he had so much cause to hate and fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long has Black-face Ned been in camp?” the
scout asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Since yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is with him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Three white men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was unlooked-for intelligence. The king of
scouts arose to his feet. The situation had changed.
It would not be safe to remain longer in this open
space. The four white men, all outlaws, so Buffalo
Bill believed, would not likely stay in camp longer than
was necessary for the return of Thunder Cloud, who
had been sent up the trail to ascertain who had come
with Colonel Hayden.</p>

<p class='c007'>After placing a gag in the Indian’s mouth, the
scout concealed two of the rifles, and with the third in
his hand left the camp and stole noiselessly toward the
rendezvous of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he went forward he considered the statement the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Indian had made. Black-face Ned was with friends.
Did he expect to find them in the Hualapi hills when
he set out across the desert? The scout believed that
the meeting had been prearranged. The three white
men were probably the members of Black-face Ned’s
band who had eluded capture when the band was
broken up. The rendezvous in the hills was an old one,
and was probably off the trail and in a secure place.</p>

<p class='c007'>After an hour’s journey, Buffalo Bill heard a suspicious
noise in the bushes in front of him. He instantly
left the trail, and, climbing the hill, got behind a bowlder.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was scarcely out of sight before two white men
appeared on the trail directly below him.</p>

<p class='c007'>One was tall, lean, and angular, with a broken nose
and an ugly disfigurement of the lower lip. One-half
of the lip was of treble the thickness of the other half,
and hung down so as to disclose the teeth, which were
long, yellow, and fanglike. The eyes were small and
piercing, and looked out under shaggy brows that were
contracted in a habitual scowl.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other man was shorter in stature, had a round,
red face, with a happy-go-lucky expression. He was
red-haired, and wore a shoe-brush mustache. The tall
man was smooth-faced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts recognized the men as two of the
most dangerous and desperate criminals in the West.
Before their association with Black-face Ned they had
been allied with the border ruffians of Kansas. In
that State Buffalo Bill had met them, and the short
man bore upon his body the marks of a luckless encounter
with the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shorty Sands and Flag-pole Jack,” muttered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>scout, under his breath. “I’ll bet the third rascal is
that sneak, Bat Wason. The three were pards in the
old Kansas days, and Wason was the slickest and the
most dangerous scoundrel of the trio.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the scout’s intense satisfaction, the desperadoes
stopped at the point of Buffalo Bill’s departure from
the trail, and began an earnest conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Indian knows his biz,” said Shorty Sands,
“and I’ll gamble he has made a killin’. Thar’s shore
no use in gittin’ skeered, fer Thunder Cloud hed only
a pigeon-hearted Hualapi ter contend with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t ye fool yerself,” responded Flag-pole Jack,
with a deepening of his scowl. “Ther ole kunnel war
too foxy ter give away the hull business. He allowed
thar war only one man with him. Mebbe he lied.
Mebbe Thunder Cloud slipped his neck inter a trap
when he pranced inter the camp of ther kunnel. I ain’t
plottin’ ter foller his example. Not by a overwhelmin’
majority.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s yer idee?” inquired Sands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My idee is ter separate right hyer. One of us will
keep on ther trail, an’ ther t’other will crope up ther
hill an’ git round ther camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Sands. “I’ll take ther hill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tall villain smiled contemptuously. “Aimin’
ter hit ther easiest snap, aire ye? Well, take it, I
don’t keer. Ther walkin’s better along the trail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He might have added: “I’ll go mighty slow until I
see how you come out,” but he didn’t.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shorty Sands was about to start, when a rattlesnake
crawled out of a hole in the bank, and, at sight
of the outlaw, coiled and rattled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The snake was between Buffalo Bill’s bowlder and
the trail. Shorty Sands uttered a cry, and then drew
his revolver to fire. A warning from his companion
to desist came too late. The revolver cracked, and
the snake, unharmed, leaped its length toward the
shooter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then it was that Buffalo Bill, excited by the shot,
the meaning of which he did not understand, showed
his head. He saw the snake, saw Flag-pole Jack taking
aim to shoot, and was about to give warning of his
presence, so that the fight should be a fair one, when a
series of yelps, like those of wolves, made him quickly
turn his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The snake was dead as the two outlaws, as much
amazed as the king of scouts, looked up the bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>There in two lines, of a dozen each, crouched a
curious and startling body of human beings. Each was
arrayed in wolfskins, and each face was masked with
the face of a wolf.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the long, black hair, that protruded below each
wolfskin cap, told Buffalo Bill that the strange newcomers
were Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the scout and the outlaws stared at the wolfish
crew, taking note at the same time that each member
was armed with rifle and tomahawk, the leader cried
out in good English: “Surrender or we fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked down at Flag-pole Jack
and Shorty Sands. The outlaws now saw him for the
first time, for, upon turning to gaze up at the fantastic
crew, he had withdrawn his head from in front of the
bowlder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buffalo Bill!” gasped Shorty Sands. “We’re in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>for it now.” As he spoke, he believed that the disguised
Indians were allies of the famous border fighter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t make a mistake, Shorty,” said the scout
coolly. “We are in the same boat.” Then he added:
“Go up, you two, and do the surrender act. I’ll follow
suit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be hanged if I give in,” snarled Flag-pole Jack.
“Hyer goes.” He jumped down the bank, but a rifle
bullet grazed his head before his feet struck the
ground. “That’s a reminder,” yelled the leader of
the Wolves sternly. “The next shot will be to kill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The outlaw, with many curses, returned to the
trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he was on the way, the Wolves marched down
the hill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was not foolhardy enough to try to make
a stand against two dozen armed enemies. He stood
up, rifle grounded, and smiled when the leader of the
Wolves approached.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fine morning for ducks,” the scout remarked, as
he tried to read the expression of the eyes that looked
out of the holes in the mask.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And for lulus. You’re one, Cody, all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill started. The leader of this fantastic
band was a white man. “I failed to catch your name,”
he said politely, as he craned his head in the direction
of the stranger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wolf laughed. “The wind must have blown it
away, I reckon,” he replied shortly. Then he added
brusquely: “Give up your arms to my adjutant here,
and place yourself in his hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, he marched down to the trail. Standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>before the two outlaws, he looked them over from
head to foot. “Pards of Black-face Ned, eh?” he said
coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>No answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drop your guns!” The weapons struck the ground
instanter. “Now go up the hill and submit to be
bound. No monkey business, or Ned will be mourning
your departure for a warmer clime than Arizona.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With black brows, Sands and his companion obeyed
the order. Soon the three prisoners were conducted
to the retreat of the Wolves. It was at the head of
a ravine about five miles south of the cañon trail, and
Buffalo Bill was surprised when he reached the spot.
It was forty feet above the bed of the ravine, and was
nothing less than one of the old habitations of the
extinct cliff dwellers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wall into which the habitation had been cut was
of irregular formation, and nearly perpendicular.
There seemed no way of reaching the holes either from
the top or the base of the ridge. But there was a way
to get up, and this passage was soon revealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Halting his band at a point directly below the holes
in the rock, the leader of the Wolves gave the hoot
of an owl. A head showed at one of the entrances,
and as soon as it disappeared the leader marched forward
to a large bowlder that rested against the face
of the wall. With one hand he gave the huge rock
a turn, and it swung back to reveal an opening large
enough for a man to enter without stooping.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inside of a minute the king of scouts found himself
in the chamber of a cave. Upon the floor about the
middle of the chamber was a cage, such as is used by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>miners in underground journeyings, and attached to it
were stout ropes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking up, the scout saw the opening through
which the cage had descended, and understood how entrance
to the cliff dwellings was obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prisoners were sent first, a windlass at the top
furnishing the motive power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had been in many of these dwellings,
and found the one that received him to be like the
others he had seen. All the furniture was of stone,
but to the utensils of the Aztecs had been added many
of the modern implements of easy, practical convenience.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were three large rooms, each provided with
a cliff outlook, and furnished with stone seats and a
plethora of bear and buffalo skins.</p>

<p class='c007'>But one Wolf was in the dwelling to receive the
prisoners. He was an Indian, and never opened his
mouth until the windlass had performed its office.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then addressed the leader in the tongue of a nation
that had been considered as practically extinct
for many years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Comanche,” muttered Buffalo Bill, under his
breath. “These reds may turn out to be friends.
Uncle Sam has had no trouble with them for a long
time. I didn’t know there was a single one of them in
Arizona.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shorty Sands and Flag-pole Jack were placed under
guard in one of the rooms. The king of scouts was
taken to another, and soon found himself alone with
the leader.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter threw himself upon the stone floor near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>a couch of skins that served as the resting place of
the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” he remarked slowly, “how does it strike
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The situation?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Sort of puzzling, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice was muffled, but Buffalo Bill was sure
that he had heard it before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take off that wolf mask and let me see your face,”
he said persuasively. “You have got me in a hole, so
that there need be no further use for a disguise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think so?” was the imperturbable response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. You know me, and I’ll bet a hat I know you.
The question is, are you an enemy or are you a
friend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that’s the question.” A pause, and then the
quick inquiry: “Have you ever heard of my outfit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are the remnants of the bravest and most fearless
nation of redskins that ever made Uncle Sam sit
up and take notice. The disguise was adopted at the
suggestion of the leader who preceded me, and who
was killed by a fall about a month ago. We are the
natural enemies of the Apaches, and Silver Moon, the
dead one, thought the Comanches could better work
in wolfskin than in their ordinary raiment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you call yourselves?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Yelping Crew. Appropriate name, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very,” said Buffalo Bill dryly. The leader of the
Crew lazily lighted a cigarette, then tossed paper and
tobacco pouch to the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We yelp to some purpose,” the strange man continued.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“During the last year we have wiped out
seventy Apaches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you cannot be an enemy of mine or an enemy
of the United States government?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No-o,” was the slow reply. “I am not your enemy,
and yet I am not quite ready to say I am your friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How can that be? You must be one thing or the
other?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me explain,” returned the leader of the Yelping
Crew composedly. “You were found with two of
the worst rascals in America. These fellows, Flag-pole
Jack and Shorty Sands—you see, I know them—the
pards of Black-face Ned, who is hand in glove with
the Apaches. Thunder Cloud is with Black-face Ned
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beg pardon,” interrupted Buffalo Bill quickly, “but
you are in error on two points. Thunder Cloud is not
with Black-face Ned, and Thunder Cloud has been cast
out by the Apaches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may not have literally struck it when I said Thunder
Cloud is now with Ned,” replied the disguised
white man calmly, “but I did strike it when I said
Ned is thick with the Apaches. The chief has not been
cast out by this tribe. He broke his parole, and was
whipped like a dog, but his tribe did not turn on him
for a little thing like that. On the contrary, his braves
backed him up when he swore revenge. He has plotted
to kill the captain who ordered the lashes and the
colonel who approved the order.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts felt a cold chill strike his spine.
“What is the colonel’s name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hayden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A groan escaped the brave scout’s lips. The keen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>eyes behind the wolf mask expressed both curiosity
and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>There ensued a long pause. It was broken by Buffalo
Bill. Speaking abruptly, he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am putting you up to be a friend. I need a
friend’s help. I not only desire to be set at liberty, but
I want your assistance. Will you give it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The leader of the Yelping Crew laughed softly.
“You are not very modest in your demands,” he replied
coolly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am what I am,” rejoined the king of scouts
sharply. Then he went on quickly and earnestly:
“Colonel Hayden is a prisoner in the hands of Black-face
Ned. Thunder Cloud is down in the cañon bound
hand and foot. I surprised him while he was trying
to execute a murderous order given him by Black-face
Ned. The Indian must be removed from the
cañon or the outlaw will find and release him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The white chief of the Comanches arose to his feet.
“Why did you not tell me this before?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Could I tell you before I was sure you were in
sympathy with my cause?” was the cold reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, certainly not. You were wise to hold back
your story. You want my help in getting Colonel
Hayden out of the clutches of Black-face Ned and his
Indian and white marauders and murderers. Well,
you shall have it. I never meant to keep you a prisoner.
Your capture was a joke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A joke?”—gazing at the masked leader in astonishment.
“Why——”</p>

<p class='c007'>A ringing laugh cut short the speech. “Fooled you
to the limit, old son. Never guessed the deception, did
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Buffalo Bill stared hard at the speaker. The truth
was creeping into his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>With one quick movement the wolf face was removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked up into the smiling
countenance of Wild Bill Hickok.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>AN OLD FRIEND REAPPEARS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The two old-time partners and fellow scouts and
Indian fighters grasped hands, Wild Bill’s knife having
quickly cut the thongs that had held the prisoner’s
wrists. After the handclasp, the king of scouts was
given the use of his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before entering upon an explanation, Wild Bill issued
an order to three of his Indians and they immediately
set out to find Thunder Cloud and convey him
to the cliff.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Wild Bill, after the Comanches had
departed, “I’ll try to satisfy your curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, seated on the couch of skins and smoking
a fine cigar, nodded. “You are in a curious position,”
he said. “I can’t imagine how you got into it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Accident, Cody, put me where I am. I had been
hunting over on the Continental Divide when, unluckily,
I provided myself with a badly sprained ankle.
I couldn’t travel, and I believe I would have starved to
death if one of the Yelping Crew had not seen and
come to my rescue. The band was far away from
their stamping ground—they had been out hunting
like myself—and so I was brought here. Their chief
was dead, and there was no one in the band capable of
leading them. Some of them knew me by reputation,
and when I was well enough to get about, what do you
think? I was asked to become the chief, pro tem.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pro tem?” repeated Buffalo Bill. “Why not permanently?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“Because there was a Comanche in the line of succession.
The fellow was in Mexico, and a messenger
had been sent there to notify him that he could be
chief of the Yelpers if he cared to undertake the
job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You accepted—your position here shows that,
Hickok. But what induced you to do so?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A desire to assist the United States government.
The Apaches are giving trouble again, and the soldier
boys are having hard work to find them. Now, my
Yelpers know all the Apaches’ holes, and they are the
sworn enemies of the Apaches. Already we have had
one brush with the enemy, and it was a win-out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why have you not descended on Black-face Ned
and his gang?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the very good reason that none of the gang
were in this neighborhood until two days ago. We
are now preparing to light down on the murderous
outfit and wipe it off the face of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, having heard Wild Bill’s explanation,
astonished the tall border fighter by telling him of the
abduction of pretty Sybil Hayden and the events of
the past twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We must move just as soon as my Yelpers get back
with Thunder Cloud,” said Wild Bill resolutely. “I’ll
make Thunder Cloud tell me where the outlaws are,
and if we don’t give them a hot surprise, I’ll resign my
job and go to herding squirrels.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the expiration of an hour the three Comanches
returned. The Apache chief was not with
them. They had found the camp of Buffalo Bill, but
it was deserted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“Rescued by Black-face Ned,” was Buffalo Bill’s
sour comment. “I half expected it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In answer to questions put by Wild Bill, the spokesman
of the trio stated that two white men had gone
away from the camp with Thunder Cloud. The trail
had been followed for a mile. There it ended on the
sandy shore of the creek.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Took to the water,” said Wild Bill understandingly.
“Never mind. We’ll find them, for I have
trailers who can match any Hualapi that ever ate
rattlesnakes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better send out your trailers at once,” suggested
Buffalo Bill. “If Black-face Ned’s force is small, he
is on the retreat. The Apaches have probably told him
about their enemies, the Yelping Crew; and he won’t
likely desire to try conclusions with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The trailers were dispatched on their mission, and
pending their return the two scouts had a talk with
the captured outlaws.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flag-pole Jack was almost stupefied with amazement
when Wild Bill, with face exposed, entered the room,
followed by the released king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Shorty Sands showed no surprise. Neither did
he seem pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shore tumbled to your game,” he said to Wild
Bill, “when you failed to wipe out Cody when he was
whar he couldn’t play a hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How many men has Black-face Ned at his command?”
demanded Wild Bill, with his eyes on Flag-pole
Jack.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ernuff ter wipe out your measly outfit, you kin bet
yer boots on that,” was the surly answer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“Then he must have a mob of Apaches with him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s got Thunder Cloud’s band, an’ thar’s more’n
fifty of ther reds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You lie, Jack,” put in Buffalo Bill sternly. “If the
Indians were with Ned early this morning, one of
them, a brave, would have been detailed to scout my
camp. As it was, Thunder Cloud was the scout.
That’s not the office for a chief, and you know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The outlaw grinned, and Shorty Sands laughed
outright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you find that is funny about this business?”
said the king of scouts, with a frown.</p>

<p class='c007'>Flag-pole Jack looked at his companion. Sands
nodded, and then the tall outlaw replied: “You ain’t
on to the sitivation, Cody. I’ll put you in line. When
Black-face Ned struck the hole of his old pards, me’n
Shorty an’ Bat Wason—you ain’t seen Bat yet, but yer
likely ter meet up with him afore long—thar wa’n’t no
Injuns thar. They was camped five miles beyond.
See? Well, yesterday Thunder Cloud, all by his lonesome,
meanders inter ther hole. He sees ther gal what
Ned is a-herdin’, an’ he corrals her name. Jumpin’
Jiminetty, but you orter seen him when he heerd it
war ‘Hayden.’ The kunnel was onto his black list,
you wanter understand. Right away he ’lowed that
Hayden war not fur away. ‘In course,’ said he, ‘he’ll
follow you, Ned, an’ I wonder that you ain’t had
scouts out a-safeguardin’ your retreat.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ned sniffed, an’ said he wasn’t worryin’ any erbout
a pursuit by ther kunnel. But Thunder Cloud stuck to
his guns. He induced Wason ter trot to ther Apache
camp an’ tell ther reds ter hike up ter Ned’s hole, an’
yarly this mornin’, afore the Indians appeared, ther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>chief lit out fer ther desert. Now, yer have it,” concluded
the speaker. “Ther Injuns aire with Ned now,
an’ Thunder Cloud at ther head of ’em with blood in
his eye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was disturbed by this statement. His
eyes sought Wild Bill’s. The same thought was in
the mind of each.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a word, Wild Bill turned, left the room,
and, going to one of the cliff openings, looked out into
the ravine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was at his side when he said: “If that
scoundrel told the truth, and I think he did, Black-face
Ned will not run away. He will hunt us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, there came the report of several shots.
The firing was about half a mile away down the ravine
toward the cañon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My scouts have bumped against a scouting party
from the enemy,” remarked Wild Bill. “I’ll wait five
minutes, and if I don’t see my Indians, I’ll start out
with all my force.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bad plan,” replied Buffalo Bill, with a shake of the
head. “You might fall into a trap. Better get the
lay of the land before starting. I have another, and
I think a more sensible, scheme. I’ll go out alone.
The bushes are thick in the ravine, and I have been on
the plains and in the mountains long enough to know
how to work. I shan’t try to get on the trail to the
cañon, for that would bring me into the zone of danger.
No, I’ll take to the high ground, and try to spy
out the location of the enemy without exposing myself
as your Comanches must have done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill tried to dissuade his old partner from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>undertaking the work, but Buffalo Bill was determined,
and at last Wild Bill gave in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you’ll understand this,” the latter said, with
lips set in grim determination: “If you fail to show
up in an hour, out I go and all my Yelpers with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Five minutes went by, and there was no sign of the
Comanche scouts. There had been no more firing, and
the king of scouts concluded that the Comanches had
either been killed or taken prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill saw his comrade go down the shaft to the
ground entrance, and there was a cloud on his brow
when he turned from the windlass and spoke to the
Comanches who had been taking in the scene with puzzled
countenances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not far from the cave entrance to the cliff habitations
the ravine narrowed so that passage along it was
beset with danger. The banks were steep and high,
and climbing would be slow and difficult work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was too wise to attempt a journey
through this narrow pass. Instead, he went up the hill
where the ravine was wide, and did not stop until he
had reached the summit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the trees were few and scattered, and to go
on with an approach to safety he must flatten himself
on the ground and work forward like a snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was making good progress, and was approaching
ground where huge bowlders took the place of
trees, when his quick ear caught the sound of a muffled
groan in front of him, and not far away. In an
instant he was concealed behind a large rock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The groan was repeated, and the scout, peering
round the rock, saw an Indian crawl into view not ten
yards away. His face was contorted with pain, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>when he stopped and began to nurse one of his ankles,
an explanation of the groaning seemed to be afforded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seemed to be, for Buffalo Bill was not quite satisfied
as to the genuineness of the Indian’s sufferings. Perhaps
the Indian, who was an Apache, had seen the king
of scouts and had resolved upon a ruse to make victory
over the white enemy an easy one.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Buffalo Bill waited, and he smiled when, after
a few moments, the Apache stretched himself at full
length upon the summit and let out a groan that could
have been heard a quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts, still smiling, picked up a stone
of good size, and, watching his chance, flung it with
all his force at the Indian’s head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The aim was a true one. The stone struck the
Apache on the ear, and he jumped to his feet as if he
had been on springs.</p>

<p class='c007'>For one short moment he looked toward the rock
where Buffalo Bill was hidden, and then hastily retreated
to the shelter of another rock a few feet from
where he had fallen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts could have shot the Indian while
he was standing, but for many reasons he had not used
his revolver. A shot might bring on a force of
Apaches, who were probably close at hand. But Buffalo
Bill resolved that the Indian should not leave the
summit to report what he had encountered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assured that stereotyped devices to deceive the
Apache would not work, the king of scouts determined
upon a course of flanking.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the large rock as a screen, he backed away
until he reached a cut in the ground that extended diagonally
for several hundred yards.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Crawling in a direction that would bring him sidewise
to the rear of the rock behind which the Apache
was concealed, he reached the end of the cut, and then
cautiously lifted his head and looked toward the Indian’s
place of shelter.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his surprise and annoyance the Indian was not
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon a light broke in upon his understanding. The
Apache was as wise as he, and had tried the same
game.</p>

<p class='c007'>Back along the cut the king of scouts hurried, and
was nearly at the point from which he had entered the
depression when he saw the Indian’s head projected
from behind a mesquite bush that grew on one side of
the cut.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as a flash, Buffalo Bill was out of the cut and
behind the rock that shortly before had sheltered him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache had not had time to fire, and the king
of scouts, immensely relieved at the circumstances,
looked out to find that the Indian had withdrawn from
a position of danger, and was nowhere to be seen. But
it was apparent to Buffalo Bill that the cunning enemy
was behind one of the bowlders near the cut.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation in one sense was to the liking of the
famous Indian fighter. He was anxious at this time
to avoid a commotion that would bring down upon
him a mob of savages, for a fight then and there, even
if it resulted in the scout’s escape, might prevent a
descent upon the camp of Black-face Ned and his Indian
allies.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the Apache could be captured or put out of the
way without noise, the scout might pursue his journey
under favorable auspices. And the Indian must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>rendered powerless for harm, the king of scouts resolved,
and so he welcomed the approaching battle of
wits.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time no move was made by either white
or red man. One thing was in Buffalo Bill’s favor:
The Apache could not leave his hiding place to reach
either the cut or the rocks on the other side of the
scout without being observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, Buffalo Bill could go forward
toward the destination he had set out to make without
exposing himself. He resolved to do this in the hope
that he would be able to bring the Apache out of cover
and to a point from which an attack could safely be
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without noise, he backed to the rock originally used
by the Apache, and from that to another, and so on
until he had placed himself a quarter of mile beyond
the Apache’s station.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here in a hollow, between two bowlders whence he
could command a view of the country in all directions,
he waited for what was to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>For ten minutes he waited in vain. Then he saw
the Indian crawl out of the cut and throw himself on
the ground and listen for sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hearing nothing and evidently puzzled, he crept to
the rock that had been his hiding place after Buffalo
Bill had thrown the stone, and a low exclamation
escaped him as his eyes fell upon the scout’s prints in
the sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now he proceeded with the utmost circumspection
to follow the trail the white enemy had left.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill knew the Indian was coming, and
smiled, for before taking his position between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>bowlders he had been shrewd enough to cover his trail.
He had left the prints of hands and feet in the sand
up to a point of a few yards to the right of the two
bowlders. The prints terminated at the side of a single
bowlder that stood in front of a stunted tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tree was provided with a few live limbs, one of
which hung over the hollow between the two bowlders.
Buffalo Bill had used this limb to reach the
hollow, and he was well satisfied with the ruse when he
saw the Apache halt near the bowlders by the tree
and look curiously at the plain trail in the sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment he stood in full view, and then walked
straight for the hollow that concealed the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts had not been expecting a move
of this kind, but he made no attempt to retreat. He
believed that the Indian was unaware of his presence
in the hollow, and, therefore, resolved to give the foe
the surprise of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache, a tall, fine specimen of his tribe, was
within a few feet of the hollow when Buffalo Bill
jumped up, gave a spring, and had the redskin by the
throat before that surprised aborigine had time to
realize what had happened. And now ensued a struggle
that called into play all of Buffalo Bill’s resources
of mind and muscle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache was powerful, supple, and as slippery as
an eel. He had his adversary about the waist, and, in
spite of the terrible pressure about his windpipe, his
grasp tightened until the king of scouts thought that
his ribs would collapse.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the end came in a manner that neither combatant
had anticipated. In moving about, the Apache’s
foot struck a stone, and in tumbling his hold on Buffalo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Bill was relaxed. In an instant he was lying on the
ground, and the scout was sitting on his chest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fall had partly stunned the Indian, and he
was soon placed so that further resistance was impossible.</p>

<p class='c007'>When ready for a renewal of hostilities, he discovered
to his rage and disgust that his hands were
tied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you raise your voice to call your fellows,” whispered
the king of scouts, in the Apache tongue, “I’ll
kill you. Understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heap understand,” was the hoarse reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are your comrades?” asked the victor, with
a menacing expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where were they when you set out to scout the
summit?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the cañon of the Hualapis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s down below where I had my camp, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache nodded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are your fellow braves and Black-face Ned’s outlaws
going to attack the Yelping Crew?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see. You wish first to learn how large a force
the Wolf Faces are able to muster.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder Cloud desires no fight with the Yelping
Crew. If the chief of the Yelpers will release the
white men he has captured, Thunder Cloud will withdraw
from these hills.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Meaning Flag-pole Jack and Shorty Sands, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you on your way to the cliff dwellings when
you ran afoul of me?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“No, I was afraid a white man who escaped from
the castle this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill received this statement with great satisfaction.
Of course, the escape was Colonel Hayden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Escaped from the castle,” he said. “Is that the
name of the Apache stronghold in these parts?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache shook his head. “No, the white friend
of Thunder Cloud holds the place. He calls it the
castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this conversation no attempt is made to use the
precise language of the Indian. The Apache language
was used, and a fair translation into English is given.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is this castle? And where is it? You might
as well come out with the whole truth, for you are at
my mercy, and my motto is ‘death to liars, especially
if they be Apaches.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian was unmoved by this speech. His face
was stolid as he replied: “Greathead will not lie, because
the mighty white scout will find no one at the
castle. Black-face Ned has deserted it. He has gone
to another retreat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone without attending to the Yelping Crew?
Without trying to rescue Flag-pole Jack and Shorty
Sands?” Buffalo Bill gazed incredulously at the Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He has gone with the white maiden, but he has left
behind Thunder Cloud and the white man who is called
Wason to manage the affair with the Comanches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How about my affair? Does he not know that I
am in these hills?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. Who was to tell him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” said the king of scouts to himself.
“Jack and Sands couldn’t, for they were captured just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>after they clapped eyes on me. Hold on, though.
There is Thunder Cloud. He knows I am here.”
Again addressing Greathead, he said: “Your talk
won’t wash. Thunder Cloud must have told Ned that
I am here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The chief did not see his white friend when he returned
to the castle. Black-face Ned had gone. He
left with the white maiden shortly after Thunder
Cloud set out to scout the camp of the white maiden’s
father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, that explains it. So the colonel escaped.
When did he get away? Before Black-face Ned took
his departure for another stamping ground?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The white maiden’s father has not escaped,” replied
the Indian calmly. “Greathead did not say that
he had done so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill exhibited the greatest astonishment.
“Not the colonel?” he said. “Then who was the white
prisoner who escaped?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A blame’ long-nosed idjut whose handle used ter
be Allen,” said a grunting voice behind the king of
scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill turned and saw a tall, ungainly figure,
with a long face, a hawklike nose, and two keen,
snappy eyes, and his voice rang out in a glad cry:
“Alkali Pete! Of all men in the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old plainsman, who had been in many campaigns
with the king of scouts, was so delighted at the
meeting that he opened his mouth in a grin that exposed
a cavern of enormous size. This cavern was
surrounded by yellow tusks, with such an irregular
alignment as would have brought a sigh from any
dentist in the land.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Mortally s’prised ter see ther old man, aire ye?”
he said, with a chuckle. “Ther s’prise is muchal. I no
more expected ter run inter ye, Buffler, than I expected
ter be persented ter ther Queen uv Maddygoosker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what are you doing in Arizona? I thought
you had settled down in Kansas or Illinois, and was
occupied in raising a family of Alkalis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hev settled down, Buffler,” replied the ungainly
scout, with a sigh, “but this year I hankered arter ther
old life. I shore told my wife that I must hev a
mounting outing, or else I’d go plumb crazy. She reasoned
with me, but it wa’n’t no sorter use. I war bound
ter go, an’ hyer I be, stanch, loyal, an’ true, like a pig’s
foot in mush.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Same old Alkali,” laughed Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Erbout ther same, but not quite. My feet shore got
tender a bit while I was cahootin’ with them innercent
rickaroons that raise corn an’ mortgages along
ther Missourah.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand. You wouldn’t have fallen into the
hands of the Apaches if you had come out here with
your wits rodeoed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a plumb true remark, Buffler,” rejoined
Alkali Pete sadly. “I was too fresh when I hit these
yer hills. I hed reckoned that ther ’Paches would let
an honest white man alone. I hedn’t hearn that they
hed been puttin’ on the war paint ag’in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How were you captured?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”—in deep disgust. “Why, when I war
snoozin’ on ther bank of ther crik on t’other side of
those hills. Hed been huntin’, and hed killed a b’ar
an’ two deer. War powerful tired, an’ while I war
sleepin’ ther sleep that innercence only is shore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>acquainted with, ther ’Paches crope up and corralled
me ez easy as if I war a lost babby. Shucks! it shore
makes me dumgasted weary when I recollects how I
war taken in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were there any white men among the Indians?”
inquired Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nary a one. They war all ’Paches, an’ that old
thief, Thunder Cloud, war ther leader. Ther capture
happened a month ago, an’ I war with ther reds,
moseyin’ hither an’ yon up ter a couple o’ days ago,
when we hot-footed it fer ther castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The castle? I have heard of the place, but I don’t
know where it is, and I have no idea what it looks
like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a stone fort at the head of a valley, Buffler.
Thar aire trees all round it, an’ I reckon it war built
in ther year one by ther Azticks or ther Woodsticks,
or some other tribe of flat-headed mavericks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill slapped his thigh. “I know the place
now,” he said. “I was there years ago. No one lived
there then. The plainsmen called it the Palace of
Adam.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hed an idee that Adam lived thar onct, did they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps. I never asked them. Come, let us talk
fast. There is work to be done. How long did you
stay in the castle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t stay thar a minute. The Injuns camped
outside, an’ this mornin’ I shore bade ’em farewell.
I played possum onto ther thievin’ outfit, an’ believin’
I war sick ernuff ter peter, they made my cords easy
ter bear. They made ’em so easy, Buffler, that I beat
’em an’ got away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you know when you left the Indians that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Black-face Ned and his band were in the castle, and
that there were two white prisoners there—Colonel
Hayden and his daughter Sybil?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Allen blinked his eyes. “Never knowed anything
erbout outlaws or prisoners. Ye shore hev got a
story ter tell. Out with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill complied. He spoke hurriedly, and his
tale caused the lanky plainsman to exhibit the most intense
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be eternally obfusticated an’ fried inter
goose grease ef this don’t beat ther Dutch, an’ ther
Dutch beat ther devil,” he ejaculated. “Wild Bill hyer
a cahoodlin’ with ther Comanches, an’ you, Buffler,
outer as purty a case as you ever tackled. I’ll take a
hand myself. I’m mortal glad I kem ter Arizony.
Aire ye ready ter mosey? Ef ye aire, take ther lead,
an’ I’ll come a-trottin’ arter ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill considered the situation thoughtfully.
After a few moments, he said: “I must go on alone.
I will give you a job that ought to be to your liking. I
lost one Indian this morning. I don’t wish to lose a
second one. I want you to take Greathead here to the
cliffs and deliver him over to Wild Bill. Having done
that, go out and keep an eye on the trail leading to the
cliff. Maybe the Indians are already marching against
the Yelpers. I’ll scout about the castle, find out who is
there, ascertain if Greathead told the truth when he
asserted that Black-face Ned had left, and then I’ll
hurry back to take part in the fight between the
Apaches and the Comanches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Pete nodded, and when he had gone from
sight, with the Indian in tow, the king of scouts continued
his journey toward the haunt of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The route he took would bring him to the farther
end of the valley that held the stone fortification.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not obliged to use the cañon in which he
had camped, and he hoped by moving in a direction
opposite to that the Apaches would have to take to
reach the cliff dwellings that he might meet with no
obstructions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the rocks on a ridge that overlooked the little
valley he halted, and for some minutes listened for
sounds and looked for signs of life in or about the
stone structure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>ENVIRONED BY PERILS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buffalo Bill could see a portion of the building from
his coign of vantage, but this portion was the rear.
The door, that opened into a walled inclosure of several
acres, was open, and this circumstance led the
scout to believe that the castle was vacant.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the lapse of fifteen minutes, Buffalo Bill began
a cautious descent of the ridge. He reached safely
the wall surrounding the castle, and there paused and
again listened for sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hearing nothing, he stole round to the front. The
wall gate here was not locked, and he walked into the
inclosure, and did not stop until he came to the heavy
door, which, like the door at the rear, was open.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it was that the fearless king of scouts did some
responsible thinking. It was certainly strange that the
front gate should be unlocked, and that both doors
of the castle should be open. Had they been left
open by design?</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked up at the window. There were two at
the front, and each was small and heavily barred. The
bars were close together, so that it would be impossible
for an enemy to shoot any person on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>After some moments Buffalo Bill retreated to a position
outside the gate. He was not yet ready to enter
the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the valley, which was not half a mile in length,
the utmost silence reigned. The scout went to the edge
of the grove of trees that screened the castle, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>gazed down the valley. There was not a human being
in sight. On the face of things, the Indians and the
outlaws had departed. It was reasonable to suppose
that Thunder Cloud and his band had gone to give
battle to the Yelping Crew, and yet the scout was in
doubt on the point.</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned to the castle, and once more stood just
without the open doorway. While he was debating
with himself as to his course of action, the sound of a
moan fell upon his ears. The sound came from
within the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scout pricked up his ears, but he did not move.
The moan was repeated, and Buffalo Bill thought he
heard the voice of a woman speaking soothingly to
some one in need of comfort. Instantly the conviction
came to him that he was listening to the voice of
Sybil Hayden, and that the moans had been uttered by
her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with the conviction there came no sense of security.
It was not probable that Black-face Ned had
gone off leaving his prisoners without a guard.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was hesitating over his situation, when a voice
that was unmistakably that of a man said roughly:
“Shut up, or I’ll smash your head.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts cast discretion to the winds
when following the threat came the scream of a
woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>He sprang to the doorway, and crossed the threshold
to fall into the trap that had been laid for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>From behind the door two men leaped out, and
heavy clubs descended upon the scout’s head. The
blows dazed, but did not send him to the stone floor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>There was not time to draw a pistol, but he made
good use of his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>He closed with the ruffians who had so brutally assaulted
him, and so quick were his movements that one
was on the floor with an aching head before he could
realize that he had caught a Tartar.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other outlaw dropped his club when the thoroughly
aroused and desperate king of scouts made the
fight one at close quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a powerful fellow, and received the fist
jabs that Buffalo Bill contributed without losing his
ground. In return, he sent in one stem-winder that
lifted Buffalo Bill off his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fight was going on fiercely, when a voice at the
lower end of the long, broad hall shouted encouragingly:
“Go in and win, Pigeon. I’m bettin’ on you.
Give him one under the ear. You’ve got him going.
One more good punch will lay him out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here Black-face Ned—for the speaker was the abductor
of pretty Sybil Hayden—spoke with undue confidence.
Buffalo Bill, recovering from the blow that
approximated a knock-out, now fought with more
wariness. He perceived that his antagonist was an
experienced pugilist, and he resolved to give evidence
that he himself was no novice in the manly art.</p>

<p class='c007'>An opportunity to make his mark came when the
outlaw, believing from Buffalo Bill’s wabbling that the
scout was about ready to fall, made a furious rush,
with the intention of mixing things. In an instant the
king of scouts changed his tactics. He side-stepped,
ducked, and then struck. The blow caught the outlaw
on the point of the chin, and he went down, and stayed
there. Coincident with the knock-out blow, Buffalo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Bill whirled to confront Black-face Ned. Too late to
save himself. A revolver cracked, and the brave scout
put his hand to his heart, and then staggered and fell
at the feet of the unconscious pugilist.</p>

<p class='c007'>His hands and ankles were being secured when he
opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alive, are you?” said Black-face Ned, in surprise.
“I thought my shot a finisher, but I wanted to make
sure of you, so I gave you the cords.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I am not mistaken,” replied Buffalo Bill quietly,
“your bullet struck a steel plate that covers my heart.
The shock dazed me. Otherwise, I don’t believe I
am hurt at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right,” returned the outlaw leader composedly.
“There’ll be a chance to have some fun with
you before giving you a real, Simon-pure send off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts made no reply to this statement.
After a moment he asked: “Were you looking for me
to appear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure. When Thunder Cloud told me you were
here, I believed you wouldn’t rest until you had found
the castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill thought of the story told by Greathead,
the Apache.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was informed a while ago by one of your allies
that you had left the castle,” he said. “He must have
lied to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, he didn’t lie. I did quit, but I did not go far.
The leaving was a ruse to fool you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fool me? Did you count on my overcoming
Greathead?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, for Greathead was sent out to round up that
long-legged fool they call Alkali Pete. But all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Apaches were told about my going, and I was betting
that you’d get the information from one or more of
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t meet any of them,” said Buffalo Bill sadly.
“They went toward the cliff dwellings, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve hit it, and I am looking for an early return
and a couple of dozen scalps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, you don’t expect them to scale the cliff, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They won’t have to,” returned Black-face Ned
quietly. “The Comanches will come out on the level
ground and permit themselves to be shot down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts did not know what to make of
this speech. The outlaw appeared to be in earnest, and
yet the statement seemed preposterous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They would be fools to come out of their stronghold,”
he remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think so? What if I tell you that the Comanche
they have selected as the chief will call them out?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Explain—I fail to understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The leader of the outlaws laughed. “Didn’t know
we had captured their chief, eh? Well, we did corral
the fellow. He has been in Mexico, and Thunder
Cloud nailed him last night. Here is the proposition:
The Apaches and the Comanches have been pulling
hair for a long time. Thunder Cloud catches this Black
Wing and gives him to understand that the Apaches
are tired of war, and want to patch up a peace with
the Comanches. See? ‘Now, says Thunder Cloud,’
using the words I put into his mouth, ‘if you will use
your influence, all this killing and scalping will come
to an end, and we’ll fix on a fair division of the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>so that each tribe will have ample territory of its
own.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black Wing agreed to use his influence, and he
went off a while ago with Thunder Cloud and the
Apache braves. Of course, Black Wing’s counsel will
prevail, and, of course, when the Comanches come
out into the open to cement the treaty they will get
it where the chicken got the ax.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill heard the explanation, and was not uneasy
in mind. He knew something that Black-face
Ned did not know, and that was the presence among
the Comanches of Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the outlaw who had been floored by the king
of scouts had recovered his senses, he assisted Black-face
Ned in carrying the prisoner to a room in the
rear. It was provided with a few modern conveniences,
among them a table and a chair. There was no
bed, but a roll of Navaho blankets in a corner contained
a suggestion that promised a sufficiency of restful
comfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leader of the outlaws, a pleased expression on
his dark and not unhandsome face, directed his man to
spread the blankets, and when they were in position
the king of scouts was deposited upon them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one window in the room, without glass—a
square hole in a thick, stone wall—was barred like the
windows at the front of the structure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was gazing at the window, when Black-face
Ned said, with an evil smile: “No chance of
escape, William. You are as secure as if you were
in a dungeon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker was walking toward the door, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the prisoner asked quickly: “Where are your other
prisoners, Colonel Hayden and his daughter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In another room. Would you like to see them?”—showing
his teeth maliciously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am extremely sorry that I cannot take you to
them. But I will be pleased to convey a message.
Shall I say that you are here, and that you are so busily
engaged in making your will that you cannot come to
them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill glared at the villain, but vouchsafed no
answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two outlaws went out, the door was barred, and
the king of scouts was left to his reflections, which
were far from pleasant ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not doubt that his death had been decreed.
The reputation of Black-face Ned was such that the
scout had no hope that leniency would enter into any
of the villain’s calculations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after noon, the outlaw, who had had the
disastrous encounter with the prisoner, and who had
been addressed as Pigeon, entered the room with a
tray of eatables.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was hungry, and he ate until nothing
was left on the tray but empty dishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>While he was eating, the king of scouts glanced at
the feet of the outlaw. The toes were turned in, and
the man’s nickname was at once explained. “What
do they—your pards call you?” the scout asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outlaw scowled. “They shore aim ter be
funny,” he answered. “My name is Isaac Alexander,
but ther blame’ fools call me Pigeon-toed Ike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Been here long?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“No; I blew in yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s Ned going to do with me? Did he tell
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He ’lowed he was goin’ ter send you pikin’ up ther
flume.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When is the interesting event scheduled to take
place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’ ye get gay, Cody. Yer up agin’ ther real
thing this clatter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It looks like it,” soberly admitted the prisoner. A
pause, and then he asked: “Has Thunder Cloud’s outfit
returned?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, an’ Ned’s gittin’ oneasy. Maybe we’ll light
out fer ther cliff if Thunder Cloud fails ter show up
inside of an hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill received this statement with satisfaction.
But he concealed his feeling beneath a mask of
indifference.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pigeon-toed Ike went out, and half an hour later
Black-face Ned came in. The outlaw leader was in
an angry mood. Fixing his sharp eyes on his prisoner,
he said sternly: “There’s a hitch up at the cliff, and
I’ll bet you know what’s up. Tell me the truth, or
I’ll kill you here and now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain drew a bowie knife from his belt, and,
walking over to the side of Buffalo Bill, shook the
weapon in the prisoner’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an instant he met with an astounding surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up went Buffalo Bill’s hands, and the knife was
wrenched from the villain’s grasp. Before a move in
self-defense could be made, the knife was buried in
the outlaw’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>As he fell to the floor, the king of scouts arose to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Black-face Ned was gasping for breath, and his eyes
reflected an expression of mingled pain and fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>After quickly removing his victim’s other weapons,
Buffalo Bill stanched the flow of blood and bound up
the wound. This done, he secured the villain’s wrists
and ankles. “I’ll not stuff a gag in your mouth, if
you’ll promise not to cry out for help,” said the victor
coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reply came in a faint voice: “I couldn’t yell if
I wanted to. I—I am dying.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense,” was the harsh response. “I knew what
I was about when I did the sticking. You are not
hurt to speak of. I didn’t even scrape a rib, and your
heart is as whole and”—with a stern look—“as black
as ever it was. The blood-letting will do you good.
It will take some of the aguardiente poison out of your
system.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Black-face Ned breathed a sigh of relief. “I wish,”
he said, “I had a good snifter of the real thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts always carried a flask of whisky
for emergencies. He produced it, and allowed the villain
to swallow a generous dose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” said Black-face Ned gratefully. “You
are not a bad sort, really.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That so?” returned Buffalo Bill, with uplifted eyebrows.
“Maybe you and I will be great friends before
we get through with our little affair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The wounded villain smiled sourly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon he asked: “How in the dickens did you get
loose? I would have sworn that I had you tied for
keeps.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Tied with rotten leathers, that’s what I was. Pity
you did not inspect the cords before you started to use
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain swore softly. Then his eyes sought the
floor. Presently he said: “Bend over me. I want
to whisper something in your ear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the king of scouts, who at the moment had
heard a noise outside the door, declined to comply
with the request.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am onto you, Ned,” he whispered. “You want
to get me where Pigeon-toed Ike can surprise me. Not
to-day. The program will be a surprise for Ike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker was about to walk to the door to be
ready for the outlaw when he should enter, but was
stopped by an important suggestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned, and stooped over the form of his victim,
bandanna in hand, for the purpose of gagging him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he was prevented from accomplishing his purpose
by the quick action of Black-face Ned.</p>

<p class='c007'>A hoarse cry, loud enough to be heard outside,
issued from his lips as Buffalo Bill was in the act of
placing the gag.</p>

<p class='c007'>The door instantly opened, and if the king of scouts
had not thrown himself to one side, a bullet would
have cut short his career.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second shot from Pigeon-toed Ike’s pistol went
wild, and before he could fire again, a bullet from the
revolver, taken from the person of the wounded outlaw,
penetrated the brain of the assailant, and he fell
dead just beyond the threshold of the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>After assuring himself that Black-face Ned was secure
against escape, the king of scouts hurried from
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>There might be another outlaw—Bat Wason—to
deal with, for it was probable that Wason had been
placed as guard over Sybil Hayden and her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the hope that the pistol shots had not been heard
in that part of the building where the two prisoners
were confined, Buffalo Bill hastened to the hall, and
then looked questioningly at one of the two doors that
met his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the nearer one he listened for sounds. All
was silence within. Stealing softly to the other, he
again played the listener. No sound came from the
room. He tried the door, and it readily opened. The
place was empty, but he saw something that brought a
cloud to his brow. In the middle of the room was an
opening. There was a trap, and the door, a square,
thin block of stone, had been removed, and was lying
by the side of the hole.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill did not stop for investigation, but with
an apprehensive expression hurried back to the room
where he left the dead outlaw and Black-face Ned.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was not surprised, though he was intensely
chagrined to find that his prisoner was not there.</p>

<p class='c007'>No open trap in the room was visible, but the king
of scouts believed that Black-face Ned had escaped
by means of a trap that let him into the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made a quick search, and soon was rewarded
with the discovery, under the blankets, of a door similar
to the one in the other room.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was standing before the door, debating whether
or not to raise the trap and descend, when loud yells
from without brought him to a realization of a new
danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hastening to the front door, he saw nothing but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the grove of trees that shielded the castle. But the
yells continued, and he knew that the Indians were
close to the grove. No hope of escape, then, from
the front.</p>

<p class='c007'>He ran around to the rear of the castle, and was
alarmed to discover that the wall door had been
closed and locked. He could not climb the wall, for it
was too high, and there were no footholds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In desperation he turned to the door of the castle.
It was still open, and he entered, and then quickly
shut and barred it. This done, he rushed to the front,
and shut and barred the door at that point.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was now entrenched in the castle unless—unless
there were enemies in the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>But they should not come out of either of the traps
if he could help it. Into the room where the first trap
had been discovered he went, and, quickly replacing
the stone door so that it masked the hole, he piled upon
it all the furniture that the room contained. One
piece was a cooking stove, whose newness showed that
it had been brought recently to the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having worked without interruption, he was beginning
to congratulate himself upon his success, when a
disturbing thought brought a sigh from his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was stopping one hole, he might stop another,
and still a third outlet from the cellar might be left
open. That outlet must open into the inclosure.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not time to go out and search for it, so
with a grave face he hurried to the room that had
been his prison, and contented himself with barring
the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few minutes later, through one of the windows in
front, he saw Thunder Cloud and his Apaches emerge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>from the grove of trees, and saw a diminutive, thin-faced
white man, whom he took to be Bat Wason,
come from around the building and greet the Apache
chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conversation, carried on in the Indian tongue,
was overheard by the listener. The translation follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why is the chief back?” asked Wason.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because Black Wing is a deceiver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He promised to get the Comanches out of the holes
so that a treaty of peace could be made, and instead
he has put on the war paint and defies the Apaches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you try to rout the Yelpers from their holes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud hung his head. “We fired at the
cliff,” he said shamefacedly, “and the Comanches fired
back and killed four of my braves. Then we retreated
to seek the wise counsel of Thunder Cloud’s friend and
ally, Black-face Ned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll find him in the cellar. He is flat on his
back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache chief gazed at the speaker in startled
inquiry. “Has he met with an accident?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. An enemy, the most dangerous man in the
West, nearly killed him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The great white warrior, Pa-e-has-ka?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bat Wason nodded. Thunder Cloud shivered.
“Where is he now, this dreaded foe of the Apaches?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the castle. If you like, you may go in and lay
him out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian looked puzzled. The little outlaw
grinned, and then explained the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was in the cellar and got Ned out of a hole.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Buffalo Bill had gone from the room where I found
Ned, but I didn’t care about hunting him up. He is
inside, though, and has the run of the castle above
stairs, and thinks the game is in his own hands. Fool!
The provisions are downstairs, and if we can’t kill him
any other way, we will starve him to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill heard, and smiled. There was enough
in his wallet to last him three days, and much might
be done in that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apaches and Wason disappeared around the
side of the building, and the scout left the front and
hastened to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here were utensils for cooking, but there was nothing
eatable in the room. But there was a bucket of
water, the diminutive outlaw in his haste having forgotten
to take it away. There was a spring in the inclosure,
and Buffalo Bill, finding neither sink nor
pump, concluded that the water came from the spring,
and that the spring was the sole source of supply for
the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>He could see the spring from the kitchen window,
and was gratified to find that it was far enough away
to permit a line shot from the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here he resolved to take his stand. He would
keep an eye on that spring until there should be serious
menace from another part of the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour passed and no one had come into the
inclosure. Apaches were camped in the grove in front
of the castle, and presumably the two outlaws and their
prisoners were in the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was looking beyond the spring, when
he saw the head of Alkali Pete show itself at the top
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>of the wall. A moment later appeared the shoulders,
and soon the lanky plainsman was astride of the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts found himself in an unpleasant
dilemma. If he shouted a warning, the Apaches might
pursue and kill Alkali Pete, and also spoil any plan of
rescue the homely scout had prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was evident that Alkali Pete believed that the
king of scouts had met with disaster, and it was also
evident that he knew the Apaches were at the castle,
and that the outlaws were somewhere inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pete must therefore know what he was doing. But
it was with grave apprehension that Buffalo Bill saw
his old comrade descend from the wall and steal
quickly to the side of the building. Would he look
toward the window? Yes, his eyes were uplifted, and
his ears caught these words, delivered in a thrilling
whisper: “Be careful, Pete, the Indians are in front
and the white fiends are in the cellar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman hesitated a moment, and then,
indicating the rear with a jerk of his finger, stole
around the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill experienced relief when his comrade
passed from view. All might be well if the outlet from
the cellar should not prove to be near the back door of
the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was at this door, expecting to open it and admit
Alkali Pete, when a pistol shot rang out, and he knew
that his one fear had been realized. The homely scout
had passed the cellar outlet, had been seen by Bat
Wason, and—the king of scouts ceased to speculate,
for another shot was heard, followed by a scream of
agony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regardless of danger to himself, Buffalo Bill rushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>out of doors as Thunder Cloud and his Apaches appeared
at the side of the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Pete was not in sight, but there was the opening
into the cellar, and through it the king of scouts
rushed just in time to escape a fusillade of bullets
from the guns of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once inside, he closed and secured the door. A shot
made him drop to his knees. It was dark in the cellar,
and he feared that he might have jumped from the
frying pan into the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Working himself sinuously around the underground
apartment, he listened intently, so as to get
the location of his enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his surprise, all was still about him. He waited
a few moments, and then deliberately lighted a match.
The flame showed him an empty cellar. The trapdoor
in the ceiling was closed, and he was positive that no
one had escaped to the room above while he had been
in the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where, then, was the person who had fired the shot
that had whizzed by his head?</p>

<p class='c007'>He lighted another match, and, walking forward,
began a close investigation of the ground. A low exclamation
burst from his lips when, in a corner, he
beheld an open hole. A third match showed it was the
entrance of an underground tunnel, which probably
terminated outside of the castle inclosure.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the tunnel the enemy had gone, and by the tunnel
had gone, also, Alkali Pete and the prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without stopping to reflect, Buffalo Bill went into
the hole. He did not strike any matches, but crept forward
slowly and cautiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The way was not obstructed, and, after five minutes’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>progress, he reached the mouth, which was screened
by bushes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Voices not far away made him pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll shore strike ther tunnel, an’ we’ll get him
when he projecks his snoot outer ther mouth,” said
Bat Wason.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then go at once and take a position so you can
plug him when he appears,” was the reply of Black-face
Ned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it was that Buffalo Bill acted with celerity. He
was out of the tunnel, and hidden behind a bowlder a
few feet away from the brush when Bat Wason
showed his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The diminutive outlaw squatted on the ground
within a rod of the brush, his body concealed by a
rock, and waited, revolver in lap, for the king of scouts
to appear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A VENGEFUL INDIAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A line of brush extended from the mouth of the
tunnel to the base of the mountain. The distance was
about fifty feet, and in the brush somewhere Black-face
Ned and his prisoners were concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were there three prisoners or two? Buffalo Bill
believed that both Colonel Hayden and his daughter
were with the leader of the outlaws, and he feared that
Alkali Pete was also a prisoner. The lanky plainsman
had not been killed, that was certain, for if he had
been shot to death, his body would have been found
either in the tunnel or the cellar of the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts was about to give Bat Wason
an unwelcome surprise, when he saw the little outlaw
drop to his knees and begin to crawl toward the brush
by the tunnel’s mouth. Before the movement was
made, a noise resembling the chirping of a cricket had
issued from the brush. Occupied with thoughts of the
probable situation of his friends the captives, the king
of scouts had not at the moment placed sinister construction
upon the chirping. But when Wason started
for the tunnel the scout scented danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was time to act. With a heavy stone in his hand,
he sprang from behind the bowlder and threw the stone
at Wason’s head. The aim was true, and the outlaw,
flattened on the ground, gave a few convulsive
twitches, and then lay still.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the mouth of the tunnel, trying to peer through
the brush, crouched Thunder Cloud, the chief of the
Apaches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The fall of the outlaw had been attended with little
noise, and Wason had died without a groan.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the chirp of the cricket had not been answered,
and Thunder Cloud was in doubt as to the situation
outside the tunnel.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the Indian waited for developments, Buffalo
Bill, who had possessed himself of the victim’s weapons,
was once more behind the bowlder, his countenance
expressive of perplexity and indecision. He
dared not chirp in answer, for it was probable that a
chirp was not the proper response to the signal. The
foe was too wily to adopt a mode of communication
that under any circumstances could be turned to advantage
by an enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon was heard a second chirp. Quickly following
the noise came the warning, sibilant rattle of a snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts turned his head quickly, and saw
that the snake was within a few feet of the bowlder.
Instead of using a revolver, he retreated and came
into the open beside the line of brush.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment Thunder Cloud showed his head
beyond the brush that masked the mouth of the tunnel.
His eyes fell on Buffalo Bill, and the head would have
been withdrawn if something terrible had not occurred.
The rattlesnake, crawling swiftly from the bowlder
to the brush, struck without warning, and the deadly
fangs were embedded in the Indian’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a shriek of wild affright he leaped to his feet,
the white foe no longer in his mind, and, flinging the
reptile from him, began to chant the death song of his
tribe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked coldly on for a moment,
and then his humanity getting the better of his aversion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>he stepped forward, removed without resistance
the weapons of the sufferer, and then said sternly:
“Flatten out on the ground, and I’ll try to save you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud waved the scout off. “No, the hour
has come. Thunder Cloud must go to join his fathers
in the land of the Great Spirit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps, but I’ll see about that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he tripped the chief, and then sat
upon him. With a knife he cut a slit in the cheek
where the snake had operated, and, applying his mouth
to the wound, sucked out the greater part of the
poison.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then from his pocket he produced a small oilskin
package, which, on being opened, disclosed a wad of
dried leaves having an aromatic flavor. The leaves
were moistened with whisky and then applied to the
poisoned cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud, now passive, followed the operation
with staring eyes. After the leaves had been bound
in place, Buffalo Bill offered his whisky flask to the
Indian. “Drink,” he commanded; “drink the whole of
it. The combined treatment I have been giving you
will bring you out all right. I know what I am talking
about, for I have cured myself more than once.
In these snake-infested hills I always carry with me
the antidote for the poison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud, in faith and gratitude, drank until
not a drop of the liquor was left in the flask.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he lay on the ground in a half-unconscious condition,
the king of scouts stole away to find Black-face
Ned and the white prisoners.</p>

<p class='c007'>He moved with caution, for, though he knew that
the leader of the outlaws was not in a condition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>oppose physical force against his enemy, yet the villain
could use a pistol, and a shot could be made effective
from ambush.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the line of brush was without an enemy or a
friend. Black-face Ned, wounded and weak as he
was, had disappeared, and with him had gone Colonel
Hayden, Sybil, and probably Alkali Pete.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts looked up the mountainside, but
saw no sign of a human being. Yet it was to be believed
that the persons he was seeking were concealed
behind one of the many huge rocks that strewed the
steep incline.</p>

<p class='c007'>He whistled, and, receiving no answer, shouted in a
voice that could be heard far up the mountain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still no answer. “Pshaw!” he said to himself, in
disgust, “of course the prisoners are gagged. They
could not answer if they wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After a short debate with himself he returned to the
Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud was sitting up, and, though his face
was flushed, Buffalo Bill knew by the state of his eyes
that the danger point had been passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are out of the woods,” he said kindly, as he
came and stood by Thunder Cloud’s side. “In a little
while you will be able to walk. But you won’t be
in shape for work for several days.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian’s head was lowered. He was looking
fixedly at the ground. The king of scouts waited for
the redskin to speak. Several moments passed before
Thunder Cloud raised his head and looked his rescuer
full in the face. “Thunder Cloud owes his life to the
great white warrior. Thunder Cloud must pay the
debt.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Buffalo Bill said nothing in reply. But there was
smiling appreciation in his expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder Cloud is no more the enemy of the great
white warrior, Pa-e-has-ka,” the Apache chief slowly
continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Glad to hear it,” replied the king of scouts earnestly.
“This deadly enmity business isn’t what it is
cracked up to be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder Cloud asks humbly what must he do to
show his gratitude?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Buffalo Bill, “there are a number of
things you can do. First, trot out some information.
What made you go into the tunnel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder Cloud went to find out what had become
of his friend Black-face Ned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You knew, of course, that there had been a fight
in the cellar. What became of the white man who was
attacked by Ned and Bat Wason?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is a prisoner in the castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This intelligence was unexpected. Buffalo Bill’s
face clouded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was he captured outside the castle?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he ran into the arms of Thunder Cloud’s
braves at the front.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t he make a fight?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, he was running for the door when my braves
came out of the grove. They fell upon him before
he could turn his head. There were shots fired.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“After the capture you went to the cellar and found
that Black-face Ned and the prisoners had gone, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The prisoners had not gone. They were in the
room where lies the dead body of the white man they
called Pigeon-toed Ike.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The king of scouts stared at the Indian in amazement.
“They did not go off with Black-face Ned and
Bat Wason?” he said, incredulity struggling with surprise.
“How did that happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud shook his head. “Can guess why,
but don’t know for sure,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, give a guess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black-face Ned and his friend were scared. They
wanted to get away, and they thought they couldn’t go
fast if they took the prisoners with them. The prisoners
might hang back, and they could not be carried.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see,” returned Buffalo Bill, with a nod. “So they
hoisted the colonel and his daughter into the castle
room where I was confined, and then lit out through
the tunnel. This action must have been taken just
after the appearance of Alkali Pete. Pete must have
been shot at, and not knowing how many enemies were
in the cellar, he ran around to the front, expecting,
probably, that some one would come out of the front
door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He expected the great white warrior to open the
door,” said Thunder Cloud. “He told me so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how he figured out that I would come
that way when I was at the rear, for he had seen me.
However, there will be an explanation when we meet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was said calmly, and the Apache chief could
not withhold an admiring grunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good, big, brave Buffalo Bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts appeared not to have heard the
compliment. He was staring hard at the ground. Suddenly
he glanced suspiciously toward the mouth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the tunnel. “I am forgetting how I stand,” said he
quickly. “Won’t your braves follow you here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If Thunder Cloud does not return inside of an hour
they will come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The hour is nearly up. What’s to be done? You
are on my side now, and I am willing to receive advice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My braves must not be hurt,” was the grave reply.
“Thunder Cloud will keep his word and assist the
great white warrior, with the understanding that no
more blood is to be shed. Thunder Cloud will go back
to the castle, tell his braves that Black-face Ned has
forsaken them, that he wants peace with the Comanches,
and that the prisoners must be taken through
the tunnel and delivered to Thunder Cloud’s friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the ticket,” cried the king of scouts enthusiastically.
“Chief, you have a great head. I am
proud to be your friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian’s swarthy face glowed with pleasure.
He was rapidly recovering from the effects of the
poison and the antidote, and as Buffalo Bill spoke he
rose to his feet, and then leaned on the scout for support.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think you will be able to get back through the
tunnel?” anxiously inquired the scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. The weakness will soon pass, and Thunder
Cloud can crawl, if he cannot walk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Five minutes later he was out of sight in the underground
passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill sat down on the ground, and impatiently
awaited the coming of Colonel Hayden, Sybil, and Alkali
Pete.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When they come,” he said to himself, “I’ll consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the case of Black-face Ned. The scoundrel must
be captured, and it ought to be an easy stunt to catch
him, for he can’t travel fast on account of his wound.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief had not been gone ten minutes before a
series of savage yells smote the air. They came from
the direction of the castle, and the king of scouts
sprang to his feet, anger and alarm in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>A discharge of firearms followed the yells, and
more yells came on the heels of the shots.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fight was in progress, and it was clear to the mind
of Buffalo Bill that the Apaches were being attacked
by the Comanches led by Black Wing and Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doubtless the Comanches were acting under a prearranged
plan. Alkali Pete had been sent out as a scout,
and the Comanches were to follow him unless he
should return and counsel a different action. He had
not returned, and the Yelping Crew were now at the
castle, and yelping for all they were worth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts was angry because the well-meant
attack of the Yelpers might defeat the program agreed
upon between himself and Thunder Cloud. It was not
likely that the Apache chief would return with the
prisoners while the castle was being besieged by a savage
enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill looked about him, and, observing a log
lying on the ground near the bowlder that had recently
been his place of shelter, he lifted it and placed
it against the high stone wall of the castle inclosure.</p>

<p class='c007'>He “shinnied” up the log, reached the top of the
wall, and looked down into the spacious yard of the
castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not an Indian could be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apaches were doubtless in the castle, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Comanches were at the front, in the grove, or near
there.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the scout looked, a force of Comanches, with
their fantastic make-up, dashed around the side of
the castle. They kept close to the building, evidently
aware of the safety of this proceeding. The Apaches
could fire only from the windows, and these were high
up, and so netted with bars that they were of no service
unless the enemy should appear far out in the inclosure.
At the head of the Yelpers was Wild Bill. He saw
the king of scouts perched on the wall, and gave a
shout of welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The drop to the ground was about fifteen feet, and
for a moment Buffalo Bill had a mind to drop and join
his old comrade. But a different counsel prevailed as
he saw the Yelpers approach the rear of the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Climbing back to the ground outside the wall, he
entered the tunnel and hurried quickly through it.
His intention was to reach, if possible, the room in the
castle where Alkali Pete had been placed, and then
try to find a way to open the back door and admit
Wild Bill and his Yelping Crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chances were against him, he had to admit it,
but he would make the attempt, nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was halfway through the tunnel when he heard
the sound of approaching footsteps. Halting instantly,
he drew his pistol and waited for what might be a
deadly encounter. There was a possibility that the on-comer
might be Thunder Cloud, but the chances were
that the chief was in the castle occupied with more
serious concerns than the return of prisoners and the
keeping of a sentimental promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The darkness prevented the king of scouts from seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>any object in his front, and the person who was
coming from the cellar was within touching distance
before Buffalo Bill knew it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tunnel was narrow, and, therefore, each must
discover the presence of the other at the time of passing,
if at no other period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill reached out a hand, and catching the unknown
person by the wrists, flung him sidewise to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are you?” he whispered, as he tried to hold
the struggling victim down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Drat yer eyes, I’m Pete,” was the gasping reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts laughed softly. Then he assisted
the angry plainsman to his feet. “Had to act as if
you were an enemy,” he said apologetically. “Hope I
didn’t hurt you any.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My wrists will shore be sore fer a week,” was the
sour response. Then he began to chuckle. “I ain’t
mad, Buffler. Don’t ye go fer ter think so. I’m mighty
glad ter see ye. I war huntin’ ye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’m glad you have found me. Did you know
that Wild Bill and his aggregation of crack-brained
aborigines are in the castle yard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m bettin’ that I do, an’ that’s why I hiked out ter
see ye an’ git ther benefit of yer vallyble advice. I
war in ther room whar ye hed ther scrimmage with
Pigeon Toes, an’, guessin’ that no one war in ther
cellar, I raised ther trap, an’ hyer I be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t see the colonel and his daughter, did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. They shore must be in some part of ther shebang.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what advice do you hanker after?” asked
Buffalo Bill smilingly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“How ter help Wild Bill an’ ther Comanches. They
kain’t do anything from ther outside, an’ they kain’t
git in ther castle. Ef they expect the ’Paches ter come
out an’ have a set-to in ther yard, they aire shore off
their cabesas. We gotter scheme out a way ter beat
ther doors of ther castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was on my way to beat those doors,” said Buffalo
Bill coolly. “My idea was to enter the room that
held you, and then watch a chance to open the back
door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might watch a year, Buffler, an’ never git that
aire chance. I’m gamblin’ that both doors aire
guarded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter with settling the guard?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ter do that ye’d hev ter pay yer respecks to a mob
of ’Paches. O’ course, they aire fillin’ up ther hall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense, Pete. It is more likely that the most of
them are in the room where the windows are, looking
out into the inclosure. Come, let’s go back. There is
more chance of winning out, now that you are with
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go ye, Buffler,” said Alkali Pete promptly. “Ye
may be right. I hope ye aire; but right er wrong,
I’m at yer back until yer stummick caves in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” responded the king of scouts heartily.
“And now for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two scouts reached the cellar without trouble.
The trapdoor through which Alkali Pete had descended
was open, and, climbing upon Buffalo Bill’s broad
shoulders, the lanky plainsman looked into the room.
It was vacant. The dead body of the outlaw had been
removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shore don’t like ther looks o’ things,” whispered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Pete to his comrade. “Ther body war thar when I lit
out fer ther tunnel, an’ it bein’ gone sartinly shows
that ther ’Paches know I hev vamosed. Mebbe they
aire waitin’ fer me ter come back, an’ mebbe thar’s a
bullet waitin’ fer ther man that crawls inter that aire
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe they expect you to come back,” replied
Buffalo Bill. “Why should they? You were a
prisoner, and you escaped. Is it the usual caper for a
prisoner to voluntarily return to the room of imprisonment?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye talk mighty fine, Buffler, but all ther same, I’m
plumb leery of that aire room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you are afraid,” began the king of scouts, when
his old comrade quickly and roughly interrupted:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Afraid nothin’,” and upon the words he crawled
into the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>No bullet came to put an end to his existence. He
listened a moment, and then stretched himself by the
hole and assisted Buffalo Bill in getting through the
trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>On his feet, the king of scouts made for the window.
The yard, or, rather, that portion within his
range of vision, was clear of Indians. Where had
Wild Bill and the Yelping Crew gone? And everywhere
was silence. Within the house there were no
sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pete,” whispered the scout, “are we living in a land
of enchantment? Fifteen minutes ago the air was
filled with yells and gun reports. Now all is as still as
the grave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But ther Injuns kain’t hev left ther castle?” said
Alkali Pete, as he vigorously worked his tobacco-filled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>jaws. “Mebbe they aire all in ther front room. This
aire castle is stone, an’ sound don’t travel wuth a
cent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to find out what the silence means,”
returned Buffalo Bill resolutely. So saying, he went
to the door and tried to open it. The effort was vain.
The door was barred from the outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better work back through the tunnel, hedn’t we?”
suggested the lanky plainsman.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts nodded. The trapdoor was
open, and Buffalo Bill was kneeling by it, preparing to
descend when the door of the room opened, and Thunder
Cloud walked in.</p>

<p class='c007'>His countenance was grave, and he was shaking his
head as he came forward and held out his hand to
Buffalo Bill, who, upon the opening of the door, had
quickly arisen to his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I expected to find you here,” the chief said, in the
Apache tongue. “I believed you would come when
you found that I was placed so I could not immediately
keep my promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are your braves?” asked the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have gone to the cliff where the Comanches
have their home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?”—regarding the Indian in amazement.
“Gone where the Comanches are not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud gravely inclined his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say,” put in Alkali Pete. “Ye aire shore puzzlin’
us, chief. Ye kain’t ram that aire nonsense down our
throats. What aire yer leetle game?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud scowled at the speaker. He was not
in a mood for pleasantry, and he was offended at Alkali
Pete’s tone.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“The chief is all right,” said Buffalo Bill, with a
warning glance at his comrade. “He will explain why
the braves have left the castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud bowed slightly, and the scowl departed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My braves have gone to the cliff,” he said, “because
that was the wise thing to do. Black Wing, who
should be chief of the Yelping Crew, has gone with
them, and soon there will be peace instead of war between
the Apaches and the Comanches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts tried to guess the riddle the
chief was attempting to explain, but it was beyond
him. He looked at Alkali Pete, and caught a wink
that expressed contemptuous incredulity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud imperturbably went on: “The great
white warrior fails to understand. He does not know
that Black Wing, who came from Mexico to be the
chief of the Yelping Crew, was unable, when he
reached the cliff to-day, to induce the Comanches to
come out and treat with Thunder Cloud.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Yelpers did not want peace, then?” said Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They were under the spell of the white man who
has been acting as their chief, and they would not listen
to Black Wing, though he is a Comanche, and had been
sent for to become their chief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good thing they didn’t, for they would have been
led to a massacre. But who is this white man who
possesses more power than Black Wing?” inquired the
king of scouts innocently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud frowned. “The great white warrior
must not speak with a forked tongue. He knows who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the white man is, for he was with the Comanches this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I do know,” replied Buffalo Bill quickly. “I
wanted to learn whether or not you knew him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Thunder Cloud does not know the name of
the white man. He has never seen the white man’s
face, and Black Wing was not taken into the white
man’s confidence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache chief paused, expecting that the king
of scouts would volunteer the information that Black
Wing had failed to obtain. But Buffalo Bill maintained
a severe silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The revelation of the identity of the acting chief of
the Yelping Crew came from Alkali Pete. Buffalo
Bill was looking out of the window when the lanky
plainsman spoke. “Did ye ever hear uv a man by ther
name uv Wild Bill?” he asked. “He’s shore ther
hombre.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud started, and it was plain that the
announcement unpleasantly affected him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sworn enemy of the Apaches, the white devil
who shoots to kill. Yes, Thunder Cloud has heard
of him.” He ceased speaking, and looked sadly, reproachfully
at Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts met the look serenely. “Are you
at last earnestly desirous of making peace with the
Comanches?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief nodded. “Thunder Cloud has done forever
with Black-face Ned, and he now desires to live
in peace with both white man and red man. Did not
Thunder Cloud say as much when he left the great
white warrior at the mouth of the tunnel?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you did, chief, and I accept your statement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Peace you shall have. Wild Bill is a friend of mine,
and if I can get speech with him, I’ll soon bring him
round to my way of thinking. But you haven’t yet
told me how Black Wing purposes to act.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He will gain the cliff stronghold, and there wait
for the coming of the Comanches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are the Comanches now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are at the back of the castle, crouching against
the wall near the door, and waiting for the door to
open, or——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or what?” as Thunder Cloud paused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or for some signal from the great white warrior,
Pa-e-has-ka.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t they know that the Apaches have gone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. When the Comanches stole around to the
rear, my braves quietly went out the front door, and
were in the grove before Wild Bill could place watchers
at each side of the castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see. Hickok would not have counted on such a
move on the part of the enemy, and so failed to take
precautions against a sudden evacuation of the castle.
Well, when the Yelpers return to their home, if they
do return without an understanding between me and
Wild Bill, they will find Black Wing and your braves
in possession of the cliff. Then what?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black Wing will again urge the Comanches to sign
a treaty of peace. He will have the whip hand, as you
Americans say, and the Comanches may listen this time
and agree to accept Black Wing’s suggestion. And
again they may not, for that devil, Wild Bill, may
again bend them to his will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s face was sober. “It’s up to me to
act,” he said, with decision. “But before I make an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>attempt to get speech with Wild Bill, I wish to see
Colonel Hayden and his daughter. Bring them here,
if you please.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder Cloud will bring the white maiden, but the
great white warrior cannot see the white maiden’s
father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was said with compressed lips and a ferocious
expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts involuntarily clenched his hands.
He tried to speak without betraying his feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does Thunder Cloud forget what he promised?
Did he not say that he would release all the prisoners?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache chief replied, with lowering brows: “He
did so promise, but he forgot when he spoke that one
of the prisoners had already been condemned to death.
Would Thunder Cloud be willing to forget that Colonel
Hayden said ‘yes’ to the order that sent Thunder
Cloud in disgrace from the white soldiers’ camp?
Thunder Cloud would be a dog if he did not take his
revenge upon the white colonel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a stir in the cellar. Alkali Pete, who
was standing nearest the open trap, heard it, but the
noise did not reach the ears of the Apache chief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman, controlling his excitement with
an effort, flashed a warning glance at Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts interpreted the meaning of the
glance, and, therefore, made this response to the chief’s
ultimatum: “Bring the girl to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thunder Cloud glued his keen eyes to the scout’s, as
if he would read what was beyond them. But he
made nothing from the searching scrutiny. Buffalo
Bill was placidly smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>With a grunt, the Indian turned and walked toward
the door. When he was gone, Alkali Pete stooped
by the trap, and called out in a whisper: “Aire ye
thar, Hickok?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” was the quick answer. “Come down, won’t
you, and pass the word to Cody, if he is up there with
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman raised his head and told Buffalo
Bill what had been said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go down,” was the reply, “and tell Hickok that I’ll
follow presently. The chief will return in a minute,
and I must be here when he comes in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Pete, without hesitation, lowered himself to
the cellar. There was a heavy thud as he struck the
ground, and at the same moment Thunder Cloud
opened the door and pushed Sybil Hayden into the
room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>STRANGE HAPPENINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The girl was very pale, and there were signs of recent
weeping. But a look of relief came into her lovely
countenance when her eyes fell on the king of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are Mr. Cody, are you not?” she asked, as
she came up to him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and how is your father?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do not know. I haven’t seen him for over an
hour. I—am afraid——” She paused, and looked
tremblingly at the chief, who was standing, grimly, by
the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Trust in me,” the scout whispered. Then he
turned, and a revolver was pointed at Thunder Cloud’s
head. “I am sorry to again place myself in opposition
to you, chief,” he said sternly; “but it’s a case of
white blood against red. You must give up this girl’s
father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache chief’s eyes flashed savage defiance.
“Never,” he replied, and with a quick movement his
hand went to the tomahawk at his belt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill fired, but to wound, not to kill. The
bullet struck the hand that was gripping the handle
of the tomahawk, and the grip instantly relaxed. But
the Indian never flinched. Not a cry issued from his
lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Must I kill you, or will you surrender?” demanded
the king of scouts coldly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head of a white man showed itself above the
hole in the floor. Sybil Hayden saw the head, and
uttered a shriek of fear.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Instantly Buffalo Bill whirled, and at the same instant
a tomahawk whizzed, and a pistol shot rang out.
The Indian’s weapon, hurled with the left hand, went
wide of its mark, and the bullet failed to do more than
graze the scout’s scalp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man at the trap was Black-face Ned, and as
soon as the bullet sped, Sybil Hayden, scarcely realizing
what she did, sprang to the edge of the hole, and
began to kick the villain in the head. As he howled
and tried to turn so as to shoot her, she changed her
tactics and jumped with all her force upon Black-face
Ned’s hands. This was more than he could stand, and
he dropped back to the floor of the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was not a witness to the commendable
actions of the colonel’s daughter. He was occupied
with Thunder Cloud, who had followed the throwing
of the tomahawk by a savage rush forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>One hand was practically useless, but he made the
best possible use of the other. Sybil Hayden watched
the struggle first with anxiety, then with delight. The
Indian, even at his best, would have been no match for
the muscular, scientific king of scouts. Two minutes
after the assault the Indian was lying on the stone
floor, and the victor was banging the red man’s head
against the stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no cords about with which to tie up the
chief, so Buffalo Bill coolly proceeded to cut strips
from the skin suit of the Indian. A sufficient number,
tied and knotted, served the scout’s purpose, and when
he arose to his feet, Thunder Cloud was powerless to
accomplish further harm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill glanced at the open hole in the floor, and
shook his head sadly. “I am afraid my comrade has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>been killed,” he whispered. “That villain fooled him
and fooled me. I had no reason to suspect that he was
in the cellar. I don’t understand why he came back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do,” replied the girl, with a little shiver.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts nodded. “Yes,” he said, “he
hated to give you up. He is more courageous than I
had given him credit for.” As he spoke, the scout
moved toward the hole.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mustn’t go down there,” expostulated the girl.
“It would mean death for you, for, of course, he is
waiting, and his pistol is ready.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without having appeared to hear the girl, Buffalo
Bill stood near the edge of the trap and called down:
“Pete, are you there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll soon know how the land lies,” said the scout
quietly. He replaced the door over the hole, and then
held out a revolver. “Take this,” he said to the girl,
“and stand by the trap. I am going out for a little
while. When I return, I hope your father will be
with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sybil Hayden took the pistol and sat down by the
trap. “You may rely on me,” she declared firmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill went out, and, reaching the rear door of
the castle, threw back the bars and opened it. Stepping
out, he looked along the back wall of the building.
There were no Comanches there, nor anywhere in the
inclosure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surprised and ill pleased, the scout walked around
to the front. No one there. The front gate of the
wall was open, and Buffalo Bill went through the
grove of trees and looked down the valley. No sign
there of a human being.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>He thought he understood the situation. While he
was talking with Thunder Cloud in the side room with
the trap, Wild Bill and the Yelpers had stolen along
the other side of the castle, and gone out into the
valley, their objective point being the cliff home of
the Comanches.</p>

<p class='c007'>How Wild Bill had learned of the departure of the
Apaches the king of scouts could not guess, but he
must have known that the Apaches had deserted the
castle, otherwise he would have remained to besiege
the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the rear, he reëntered the castle, and
then began a search for Colonel Hayden. Every room
in the castle was investigated, but the colonel could not
be found. Mystified and vexed, the scout returned to
the room where he had left Sybil Hayden and Thunder
Cloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation in the room had not changed. The
Indian lay on the floor, and the girl was sitting by the
side of the trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you find my father?” she asked, in astonishment,
mingled with alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” replied the scout gravely, “but the chief
knows where he is, and I’ll make him tell me, or I will
know the reason why.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Going over to Thunder Cloud’s side, Buffalo Bill
stooped, and said sternly: “Where did you put Colonel
Hayden?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian, who was in full possession of his senses,
promptly answered: “He should be hanging from the
big cottonwood at the lower end of the valley.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sybil Hayden uttered a despairing cry. “No, no,”
she wailed, “you couldn’t have sent him out to die.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“Of course he couldn’t,” said the scout consolingly.
“He is mad, and he wants to torment you.”
Then to the Indian: “Why do you lie? Don’t you
realize that you are in a mighty ticklish position?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder Cloud has spoken the truth as it appears
to him. The father of the white maiden went off with
Black Wing and the Apache braves, and the order of
Thunder Cloud was that the white man who is responsible
for Thunder Cloud’s disgrace should be hanged
like a dog from the cottonwood tree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The order may not have been carried out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache chief smiled grimly. But he said no
word in reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill tried to comfort the colonel’s daughter.
“From all accounts,” he said, “Black Wing is a
decent sort of an Indian. He was bossing the Apache
outfit when he left for the cliff. He wants peace. Is
it in the line of peace to do an act that would bring
the military down upon him? Hardly. So cheer up.
I’ll bet anything that your father is now alive and in
good hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Somewhat reassured by these words, the girl dried
her eyes and insisted upon an immediate departure for
the home of the Comanches.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go as soon as I have attended to Black-face
Ned and have found out what has become of my friend
Alkali Pete. Remain here, and in half an hour, at
latest, I’ll be ready to depart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl, much as she desired to get out of the
castle and run to that cottonwood tree, did not interpose
any objection to Buffalo Bill’s proposal. She
knew he was acting as one true friend would act toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>another, and so, without a protest, saw him
leave the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts reached the mouth of the tunnel,
and then looked about for evidence that would show
whether or not Black-face Ned was inside or had again
retreated to the open country.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many footprints about; some made by
the scout, Thunder Cloud, and Bat Wason, whose dead
body was where the scout had left it, and it required
much perspicacity to arrive at the truth. At last the
scout became convinced that Black-face Ned was
either in the tunnel or the cellar. The most reasonable
supposition was that the villain was in the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Buffalo Bill realized that he was undertaking a
dangerous piece of work when he entered the tunnel.
Still, he did not hesitate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much to his relief, he made the journey through
the tunnel without encountering the leader of the outlaws.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had moved noiselessly, and when he reached the
entrance into the cellar he stopped and listened intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sound as of muffled breathing reached his ears.
“That can’t be Black-face Ned,” thought the scout.
“It must be Alkali Pete.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The darkness was intense. Buffalo Bill knew the
location of the trap, and, believing that the outlaw
leader was under it, he began to glide cautiously along
the side of the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every ten feet he would stop and listen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly his foot struck an obstruction, and he
came within an ace of falling over it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The obstruction was a human body. No sound had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>followed the striking of the scout’s foot against the
body, and, agitated by the fear that he had come upon
the lifeless form of Alkali Pete, Buffalo Bill knelt
quickly on the ground and placed his ear to the breast
of the unknown. The heart was not beating. Next
the scout passed a trembling hand over the unknown’s
face. Cold, but not icy cold. Death must have taken
place but a short time before the scout’s entrance into
the cellar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill arose with a feeling of relief. The dead
man was not Alkali Pete. The face was that of an
Indian. The scout had felt the high cheek bones, the
sharp nose, the retreating forehead, and the long,
coarse hair of an Apache.</p>

<p class='c007'>His relief at finding that his fear was unfounded
quickly gave way to a feeling of wonderment. How
came the dead Apache in the cellar? And who had
killed him?</p>

<p class='c007'>A slight noise in front of him made him put a tighter
grip upon the knife he had drawn upon entering the
tunnel. The noise was as of some one stepping softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Believing that Black-face Ned was approaching, the
king of scouts crouched by the wall, and waited with
tense nerves for the enemy to come within striking
distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The steps drew nearer, and then stopped. Suddenly
a match flared, and Buffalo Bill saw the face of the
leader of the outlaws. He had come to the body of
the Indian for the purpose of assuring himself that the
savage was dead. Before the match went out the villain
saw the king of scouts. But the sight of his enemy
came too late for him to take either offensive or defensive
action. Buffalo Bill sprang forward as the villain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>looked up, and struck him a powerful blow between
the eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Black-face Ned collided with the hard ground with
such force that his breath left his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not until the victorious scout had removed the villain’s
weapons did he light a match.</p>

<p class='c007'>The light exhibited a spectacle that brought a cry
of joy from his lips. Ten feet away, with his back
against the wall, sat Alkali Pete, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pete? Alive?” the king of scouts exclaimed, and
the answer came dryly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shore don’t know. Come over hyer an’ pinch
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The match went out just as Black-face Ned’s limbs
began to twitch.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill sat on the villain’s chest, and said
roughly: “Are you going to be quiet, or must I give
you a sleeping dose?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ll be good,” whined the now thoroughly
frightened man. “I missed the trick, and I am willing
to leave the field to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“See that you don’t change your mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lifting the outlaw in his arms, the king of scouts
bore him to the side of Alkali Pete. “I am shy on
cords,” he said to the lanky plainsman. “Got any
about you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ther one that held my wrists is hyer in my lap,
an’ when ye ontie my ankles ye’ll shore corral another,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, I am on. You were tied up, and you’ve got
your hands loose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye’re singin’ on ther right key, Buffler.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>After the villain had been tied up, the king of scouts
asked anxiously: “How are you feeling?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorter down in ther mouth. Made a fool slip
when I kem inter the cellar. Thar warn’t any Wild
Bill down hyer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know. We were both fooled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An’ I never knowed I’d been played fer a sucker
ontil a few minutes ago. I struck ther ground, an’ a
club struck me. Reckon Black-face Ned opined he’d
put me outer business fer good an’ all. Made a big
beefsteak thar, son. He shore didn’t know that my
head is some thicker nor a paper-shell almond. I hev
been a’feelin’ uv ther old cabesa, an’, barrin’ a leetle
lump, it’s shore somewhat intact.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad to hear you say that, Pete,” responded Buffalo
Bill earnestly. “I thought you were all in
when I discovered that Black-face Ned was here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman stood up and stretched himself.
“What all’s happened since I ca’mly deposited
myself inter the lap of ther enemy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll tell you after you have satisfied my curiosity
on one point. An Apache was killed here in this cellar
after you were downed. Do you know anything about
the affair?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a blessed thing, Buffler. I war sleepin’ off my
headache when ther killin’ kem off. Ask ther black
devil at yer feet, an’ he’ll tell yer what ye want ter
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so. Ned”—speaking to the captured outlaw—“what
about this Apache? Did you kill him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” was the surly answer. “Had to. I took him
for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then he made a noise coming through the tunnel?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Enough to put me on my guard. I suppose he
thought there was no one here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was his object in coming to the cellar? Do
you know, or can you guess?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know, and I am not good at guessing. But
I do know this: The Indian was Thunder Cloud’s
right-hand man, second in command, you understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He came back to see Thunder Cloud. Something
had occurred on the march to the stronghold of the
Yelping Crew. An important discovery had been
made, or there was a slip of some kind. Maybe he became
suspicious of Black Wing, and came back to urge
Thunder Cloud to come to the cliff and boss operations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This speech was directed to Alkali Pete, who at once
replied: “Let’s get ther kunnel an’ light out fer ther
cliff. Ef thar’s goin’ ter be a mix-up, an’ it shore
looks thataway, I’m hankerin’ ter take a part.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was seized with a cold fear. He had,
for the moment, forgotten about the colonel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t yet told you,” he said gravely, “that the
colonel went with the Apaches and Black Wing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What fur?” Surprise and dismay were in the tone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts repeated the appalling statement
made by Thunder Cloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Pete groaned. “I shore sees ther p’int, Buffler.
Ther ’Pache this yer Black Face downed moseyed
back ter tell Thunder Cloud that ther order ter hang
ther kunnel to ther cottonwood hed been carried out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t believe it,” returned Buffalo Bill, hoping
against hope. “Some other reason brought him back.
I’m going down to the cottonwood immediately. But
first I’ll get speech with the girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Black-face Ned had brought his rifle to the tunnel,
and the king of scouts thumped on the trapdoor with
the muzzle of the weapon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye won’t get ther girl ter open ther trap, Buffler,”
said Alkali Pete. “She’ll think ye aire Black-face Ned,
fer sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the door did not open, the king of scouts yelled
at the top of his voice: “Open. It is Cody who
speaks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the sound penetrated to the room above, no indication
of the fact was given.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to go around and into the front door of
the castle, Pete. It’s a waste of time, but it can’t be
helped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Goin’ ter leave Black-face Ned hyer?” asked the
lanky plainsman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, we’ll take him along with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The bound outlaw was conveyed to the outer air,
and there set on his feet and conducted to the front
of the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the prisoner with Alkali Pete, Buffalo Bill
entered the building. As he stepped into the hall he
saw that the door of the room with the trap was open.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circumstances induced a feeling of uneasiness,
for the scout had closed the door when he went out of
it less than half an hour before.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the threshold he stopped in amazement. Sybil
Hayden had gone, and Thunder Cloud lay as if dead
upon the stone floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts walked to the body, and his
amazement was intensified.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Apache chief was dead, and there was a bullet
hole above the right temple. His hands, freed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the leathers that Buffalo Bill had used to secure them,
were stretched out and clenched.</p>

<p class='c007'>No time was wasted in the room. Hastening back
to Alkali Pete, the king of scouts announced his astonishing
discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ther Injun got shet of the leathers, and was aimin’
ter do up ther gal when she plugged him. O’ course
that’s the way it happened, Buffler.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are probably right. There is no other sensible
explanation. But why did she leave the room? I requested
her to stay until I returned. There is something
queer about the affair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe she lit out ter hunt you up. Got tired o’
waitin’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill went to the rear of the castle, and, not
finding the girl, returned to the front, reëntered the
building, and searched all the rooms. No sign of the
girl anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Pete had to confess that the matter was beyond
him. “Gals aire pecooliar,” he remarked. “Ye
never know what they aire plannin’ ter do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill did not hear the last words of his comrade.
He was walking toward the open front gate,
his eyes on the sandy ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the edge of the grove of trees he stopped and
called to Alkali Pete. “Come on,” he said. “The girl
went off this way. I have found her tracks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman, his arm in that of Black-face
Ned, started for the grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are plenty of other tracks, mostly Indian,”
the king of scouts said, “but it was easy to pick out
Miss Hayden’s. She has gone down the valley.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“To take a look at that cottonwood, I reckon,” was
Alkali Pete’s rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Probably. I hope we will find her there, and also
that she has discovered that her father has not yet
been killed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The walk to the end of the valley was quickly performed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surprise of Buffalo Bill was great when he saw,
sitting under the cottonwood, Sybil Hayden and her
father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both rose as their eyes fell on the two scouts. With
a happy smile the girl spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been waiting for you,” she said, as she came
forward to meet the king of scouts. Then, as her eyes
fell on Black-face Ned, she added: “You have done
well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her next words were addressed to Alkali Pete, and
they were spoken with such warm earnestness that the
homely plainsman blushed. “I am so glad you are
here and well. You don’t know how badly I felt when
I found you had fallen into a trap.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden, while this talk was going on, was
shaking hands with Buffalo Bill. He was in a joyous
mood, and the compliments he paid to the valiant king
of scouts caused the recipient of them to vigorously
shake his head. Sybil relieved his confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must be anxious to learn how I came here,”
she said. “Didn’t you guess what occurred in the
room? Thunder Cloud got the use of his hands, and
was reaching forward to snatch my pistol when I saw
him and fired. My eyes were on the trapdoor while he
was working himself free, for I thought I heard a noise
below.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“After I had killed the chief I wanted to get away.
I was faint, and the sight of the blood was more
than I could stand. I rushed out of doors and looked
around for you, Mr. Cody. Not finding you, I determined
to hurry to the end of the valley and find out
whether or not the Apache chief had lied. I got to
the cottonwood, saw, to my delight, that no human
body was hanging from it, and was about to retrace
my steps to the castle when my father appeared. Black
Wing had freed him, and he was on his way to attempt
my rescue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden now made other points clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black Wing is all right,” he averred. “He promised
Thunder Cloud that he would hang me to the cottonwood,
but he never meant to keep that promise. He
is an intelligent Indian, and a true friend of the whites.
He knows that you, Mr. Cody, and Wild Bill are
friends, and that I am your comrade. Besides, he had
had an understanding with Mr. Hickok, and the two
were acting in accordance with that understanding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill whistled softly. “And Thunder Cloud
was fooled, was he? Thought Black Wing was really
working for peace, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. He pulled the wool over Thunder Cloud’s
eyes, and now Thunder Cloud’s Apaches are on their
way either to a reservation of Uncle Sam or to bloody
death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wild Bill and Black Wing have fixed up a trap,
then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think you would call it one. The Apaches will
come out of the holes in the cliff, and, instead of
marching out into the open to arrange a treaty of peace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>they will be invited to a duel. Wild Bill wouldn’t stand
for an ambush, so that the fight will be a fair one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It hasn’t commenced yet, or we would have heard
the firing,” said Buffalo Bill. The speaker looked at
his watch. It was a few minutes after four.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Five o’clock is the time set for the scrimmage,” explained
the colonel. “The palavering is going on
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Time enough to get there before the fun begins,”
said Buffalo Bill. “I’ll hear the rest of your story,
colonel, and then I’ll start.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve told all there is to tell, Cody. I was released
by Black Wing about half a mile up the hill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you have not said anything about the Apache,
Thunder Cloud’s lieutenant, who left the band and
returned to the castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t know that he returned. He was walking
by the side of Black Wing when I left the band.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did he take your release? Didn’t he expostulate
with Black Wing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he did, and I remember that he gave me a
savage look when I went away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I understand,” declared the scout, after a
moment’s thought. “The Apache imagined that Thunder
Cloud would be angry when he learned that his
murderous order had not been carried out, so he deserted
the band soon after you left, colonel, and hurried
back to the castle for the purpose of informing
the chief of your release. He selected the tunnel way
for his entrance, because he wanted to avoid being
seen by me. He knew, of course, for Thunder Cloud
must have told him, that I was free, and he was afraid
that I would suspect his errand and try to queer it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“I think he suspected more than that,” said Colonel
Hayden. “Black Wing’s noncompliance with Thunder
Cloud’s order may have set him to thinking, and he
may have feared that Black Wing meant treachery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll shore never learn ther rights of ther matter,”
put in Alkali Pete, “fer Thunder Cloud an’ his leftenant
aire both takin’ it easy in ther happy huntin’
grounds.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden nodded. “I guessed that the
Apache never got into the castle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you didn’t guess that the Honorable Mr.
Frams here gave the Apache his quietus. Yes, Black-face
Ned played into our hands, and I’ll bet he’s mighty
sorry for it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The villain scowled, but said nothing. He was in
an unenviable state of mind. He was without resources,
and saw ahead of him the gallows.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he determined to make one strong appeal to the
man he had so grievously injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me go, colonel,” he pleaded. “You’ve got your
daughter back, and you’ve cleaned me out of friends.
Let me go, and I’ll start for Mexico and never come
back. I have made a mistake, and I am sorry for it.
You’ll sleep better if you turn me loose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden’s face hardened. “You contemptible
scoundrel, don’t talk to me,” he replied, and then
turned his back on the villain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s voice was heard after a short silence.
“Colonel,” he said quietly, “I am going to take this
man off your hands and deliver him into the hands
of the Apaches. He has killed the Apache who would
have been chief had he lived, and for his offense he
must undergo an Indian trial. I can assure you it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>will be short, and that there will be no appeal from the
judgment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden smiled grimly. “As you will,
Cody,” was the reply he made. But Buffalo Bill’s
announcement had caused Alkali Pete to raise his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ain’t ye takin’ a losin’ contrack, Buffler?” he inquired.
“How on arth aire ye goin’ ter turn over
ther rapscallion ter ther ’Paches when ther prospecks
aire that ther ’Paches will soon be <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">non est combusticus?</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I intend to stop the massacre,” returned the king of
scouts quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye do, eh? Well, ye aire takin’ a mighty big job
onto yer shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have taken larger ones, Pete.” This was said in
no boasting tone, rather as a matter-of-fact statement.</p>

<p class='c007'>A flood of recollections deluged Alkali Pete’s mind.
He nodded and smiled. “I reckon I’ll haul in my
horns, Buffler. Ye’ll make it; jest how I kain’t conceive,
but ye’ll make it, or thar’ll be a circus.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to make it I must be moving,” the king of
scouts replied. “You must remain here with the colonel
and Miss Hayden, Pete. I’ll be back before dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he took Black-face Ned by the
arm and moved away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Half an hour later, and ten minutes before the
time fixed for the outcoming of the Apaches, Buffalo
Bill and his prisoner reached the edge of the opening
in front of the cliff dwellings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill saw him coming, and rushed forward to
meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“I am in time,” said the king of scouts, with a
smile as hand met hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you had come earlier you would have suited me
better,” declared Wild Bill earnestly. “I have been
worrying a bit about you. Thunder Cloud told Black
Wing about the rattlesnake business, and I believed
you were on velvet back there in the castle, otherwise
I would never have left the place without trying to find
you. But you are here at last, and I’m mighty glad
to see you. You’re just in time to see a sensational
spectacle. The Apaches are up in the cliff rooms now,
but in a few minutes they will come out, and then
Beelzebub will proceed to pop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have heard about the trap you have laid for the
Apaches,” said Buffalo Bill disapprovingly, “and I
have hurried here to have you withdraw it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Withdraw it. Have you gone daffy, Cody?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I am as sane as you are. Look here, Hickok”—speaking
with serious earnestness—“you are a white
man, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have always passed for one,” was the smiling
reply. “What of it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just this: A white man, the type of the higher
civilization, does not lay traps in order to take a mean
advantage of an enemy. He fights fair, he despises
the tactics of the savage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill’s face flushed with anger. “Do you mean
to insinuate that I have hatched up a low-down scheme
to entrap the Apaches?” he said hotly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep your temper, Hickok,” returned Buffalo Bill
quietly. “We have been friends too long for any serious
difference to arise between us. You have not yet
coolly considered the situation. You have, I am sure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>acted on impulse. Don’t you know that, if your plan
goes through, the Apaches will be at the mercy of the
Yelping Crew? They will come expecting to treat for
peace. You and your crowd will be all ready for a
fight. The announcement that it is war, not peace, will
throw the Apaches into a state of consternation so
that they will not be able to put up any kind of a fight
against you. The scheme is unfair; it is more than unfair,
it is——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do, Cody,” interrupted Wild Bill, his
countenance red with shame. “I see the point. I was
hasty, reckless. I did not take a cold squint at the
matter. The scheme won’t do. Come with me while
I do some responsible haranguing. Time is mighty
short, for the Apaches will be out of the holes in a
minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill reached the group of Comanches, and began
to talk rapidly. Headshakes and low, fierce mutterings
were heard as he urged a change of plan.
After all, he argued, it would be better to have peace.
A fight against the advice of Buffalo Bill, who represented
the United States government, would draw
down upon them the wrath of the soldiers. They
would be driven from their home, and, if they did not
succeed in escaping to Mexico, they would either be
killed or placed on a reservation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten minutes went by while the talk went on. When
Wild Bill stopped, satisfied that he won his point, he
uttered an exclamation of surprise. The Apaches had
not come out. What had happened?</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is a screw loose somewhere,” the king of
scouts remarked, with a clouded brow. “Have you
seen an Apache since you came here?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black Wing knew that five o’clock was the time
for the confab over the treaty, did he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then something has happened to him. Send one
of your Comanches down close to the cliff and have
him call to Black Wing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill ran to the base of the cliff and shouted:
“Black Wing! Are you there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>No answer. The call was repeated. Still no answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Astonished beyond measure, Wild Bill returned to
Buffalo Bill and the waiting Comanches. “I don’t believe
there’s a soul up the cliff,” he said to the king
of scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am of your opinion. Here, hook onto Black-face
Ned for me, and I’ll soon solve the riddle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without waiting for an answer, Buffalo Bill ran to
the mouth of the cave, entered, and climbed up the
rope that depended from the windlass above. As his
head appeared out of the hole in the stone floor, he
saw the dead body of an Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>The face was upturned to the ceiling, and was the
face of Black Wing, the Comanche. The king of
scouts, with serious mien, stood a moment by the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>A glance disclosed the manner of death. The Indian
had been tomahawked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other rooms were vacant. The Apaches had
gone, and with them the two outlaws, Flag-pole Jack
and Shorty Sands. But Black Wing had not been
killed by either of the outlaws. They used pistols or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>knives, never tomahawks. The Indian had met his
death at the hands of an Apache.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill went back to the group of fantastically
attired Comanches. His story was received first with
amazement, then with savage indignation. Every face
was turned toward Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The white leader of the Yelping Crew faced the Indians
with flashing eyes. “Black Wing shall be
avenged,” he said, in a voice that cut like a knife.
“Peace be hanged. We’ll march to the castle, for the
Apaches have gone back, of course, and camp there till
we starve them out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill knew that the time for conciliatory talk
had passed, so he uttered no protest, but said quietly:
“I think as you do, Hickok. The Apaches somehow
got on to Black Wing’s plan and killed him. Then they
hurried to the castle, taking the cut-off over the ridge
that I took when I went from here this forenoon. But
they may not stay there. The finding of Thunder
Cloud’s body, the discovery of the dead Indian in the
cellar, and the escape of the white prisoners will, I
think, send them out again. And if they come back
here they will come by the regular trail. Great Heaven,
Hickok, they will come by the cottonwood tree! Alkali
Pete and the Haydens may see them coming, but
the chances to escape observation are poor. Come on,
we must meet the fiends before they reach our friends,
if it is possible to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The words were scarcely out of the scout’s mouth
before the Apaches appeared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FRUITS OF VICTORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buffalo Bill saw the redskins rush out of the bushes
into the open, and at once dropped to his knees and
fired. A volley from the Apaches drowned the report
of his rifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Black-face Ned, struck in the head by a bullet meant
for Wild Bill, staggered and fell upon the kneeling
king of scouts, sending him flat upon his face. Shots
and bloodcurdling yells rent the air as he was trying
to arise.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got to his feet he saw a strange sight. The
Apaches were running up the mountainside, pursued by
enemies from two sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill and all but four of the Yelping Crew were
chasing the Apaches, while from the brush out of
which the foe had emerged Alkali Pete and Colonel
Hayden were using their weapons with telling effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts joined in the rush of the Yelpers.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Apaches, demoralized by the attack in the
rear, won out in the running race. They were out
of range when the pursuers reached the top of the
ridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seven had been killed, and there were not more than
ten, the two outlaws with them, who were able to get
to the castle.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the ridge, the king of scouts said to Wild Bill:
“Go on and invest the castle, and I’ll join you after a
while. I must have a talk with Colonel Hayden.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, but be quick, Cody, for it will be dark
before long.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Alkali Pete was coming up the hill as Buffalo Bill
began the downward walk. Below, on the flat, stood
Colonel Hayden and Sybil.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the two scouts met, Sybil Hayden was hastening
to the side of a wounded and dying Apache.</p>

<p class='c007'>In her hand was a canteen of water that her father
had given her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indian, who was sitting up with his hands at
his throat, took the canteen and drank until he almost
choked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill and Alkali Pete joined the girl, and the
colonel came up while the Apache was speaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black Wing was a traitor,” he said, in answer
to a question put by the king of scouts. “He would
have sent the braves of Thunder Cloud to be massacred
if the white friend of Thunder Cloud, he who
is called Flag-pole Jack, had not taunted him with
treachery and forced him to tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Black Wing was a fool to admit he was leading the
Apaches into a trap,” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was angry and reckless,” replied the Apache.
“The white man has a cutting tongue, and he lashed
Black Wing to fury. Then when the Apaches learned
how they had been deceived, Black Wing was made to
pay for his treachery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The last words were spoken just above a whisper.
In a few minutes the Apache was dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I must go on and rejoin Wild Bill,” said the king
of scouts to Colonel Hayden, as the quartet walked
away from the scene of death. “As for you and Miss
Hayden, my advice is, go to the camping ground by
the creek—the place is safe enough now—and stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>there to-night. Alkali Pete here will go with you, and
in the morning you can set out for civilization.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman said nothing to this speech.
But his homely face wore a look of keen disappointment.
As he caught Sybil Hayden’s smiling glance
he reddened, and attempted an explanation for his apparent
exhibition of discourtesy. “I think, I shore do,
that Buffler orter come with us. He’s got no call ter
be buttin’ inter a squabble atween ther ’Paches an’ ther
Comanches. Don’t ye see, Miss Hayden?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I see,”—and the smile broadened. Then she
added wickedly: “You wouldn’t go back and help
Wild Bill and the Comanches, would you? An ox
team couldn’t make you go. Am I right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Alkali Pete gave a shamefaced look at the smiling
girl, and then turned an appealing glance on Buffalo
Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The colonel spoke at this juncture. “Your plan
shows a good heart, Cody, but you forget that you are
under my orders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts bit his lip. “That’s so,” he reluctantly
admitted. “And what is your order?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That you go with us and let Mr. Allen proceed to
the castle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lanky plainsman’s eyes danced with pleasure.
But the new arrangement was not carried out. Sybil
Hayden vetoed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have not had my say yet,” she declared, with an
expression of determination on her pretty face. “You
may all do as you please, but I am going back to the
castle. I am interested in the squabble, as my friend,
Mr. Allen, calls it. I want to be a looker-on in Venice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>And, besides, I hope to induce you three husky men to
come with me. Perhaps the end may come the sooner
for your presence and assistance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Sybil, the danger,” expostulated her father.
“You have had enough of harsh experience, I should
imagine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No use talking, dad, I’m going to have my way.
There is no great danger. There will be about twenty
men against a dozen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are talking strangely for a woman,” returned
the colonel severely. “I am surprised at your conduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, there, daddy”—speaking caressingly—“you
have miscalled your feeling. You really want to
go to the castle. Now, be honest and tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I would like to go,” replied the colonel slowly,
“but not under your conditions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The argument went on, and finally the colonel
capitulated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quartet reached the grove in front of the castle
just before dark. There was found the greater part
of Wild Bill’s force. Two Comanches had been detailed
to watch the mouth of the tunnel, and three
others had their station at the rear of the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are sure, Hickok, that the Apaches are inside,
are you?” asked Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Several shots have been fired from the windows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your program?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To stay here and starve them out. Can you suggest
a better one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will tell you in a minute. Did those shots from
the windows do any damage?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“No. They were fool shots, fired to annoy us, I
suppose, to give the impression that the inmates of
the castle defied any attempt to rout them out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have to stay here a month, Hickok; that is,
if you are allowed to stay, before the garrison will be
out of provisions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nonsense. I know, by what Black Wing told me,
that there is not enough grub in the shebang to last a
dozen men a week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“True, but suppose there are but two persons in
the castle?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill caught his breath. “Do you mean——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” the king of scouts quickly interrupted. “I
mean that the Apaches are not in the castle. They
are playing trick against trick. Flag-pole Jack and
Shorty Sands are inside, no others are there, and the
shots were fired to make you believe the whole force
of the enemy is in there. Do you catch on? At this
minute, if I am not clear out of my reckoning, the
Apaches are preparing to sneak up and massacre your
whole outfit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They will come from the rear, then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Naturally.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill, who had been sitting on the ground,
arose to his feet and issued some quick orders to the
Comanches.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four of them at once stole away in the darkness,
going along the edge of the valley, two on each side.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as they had departed, Buffalo Bill went to
Sybil Hayden’s side and whispered: “There is likely
to be trouble soon, and you must not be where you
would run the chance of catching a stray bullet. Go
around the wall until you get to a large, low-growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>pine. Climb the tree, you will find it easy work, and
wait until it is safe for you to return here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girl at first refused to go, but upon her father’s
supplication she left for the pine.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been gone five minutes, and the scouts sent
out by Wild Bill had just returned with a startling report,
when a scream, fraught with deadly terror, awoke
the stillness and pierced Colonel Hayden’s heart like
a knife. He was running along the wall in the direction
of the sound when Buffalo Bill dashed by him,
going at race-horse speed. A pistol shot was fired
when the king of scouts was within a few yards of the
pine tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quickly following the report, a heavy body fell from
the tree, striking the ground with a thud.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was not the girl,” said Buffalo Bill to himself,
with positiveness. Then he called out in a thrilling
whisper: “Miss Hayden—where are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the tree,” was the answer given in a shaking
voice. “I—I can’t get down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you hurt?”—anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but—I am stuck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king of scouts struck a match, and, stepping
forward, looked at the body that had fallen from the
tree. It was that of Shorty Sands, and the outlaw was
stone-dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Climbing into the tree, Buffalo Bill found that Sybil
Hayden’s form had become wedged between two limbs.
By using all his strength he was able to bend back one
of the limbs so that the girl could move out. When
both were on the ground she told her story. She had
climbed into the tree, and was between the limbs when
she heard a movement above her. Looking up, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>saw the dim outlines of a man’s form, and immediately
gave utterance to the scream that was heard at
the front of the castle. Next she tried to leave the
tree, but found to her terror that she could not move.</p>

<p class='c007'>A hissing whisper caused her to stifle a second
scream. “If you yell again, I’ll cut your heart out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time she had not thought of the pistol
she carried. It was in her bosom, and she took it out
just as the outlaw was about to swing himself to a
limb opposite to her. As his feet touched the limb she
fired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did I kill him?” she whispered faintly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I couldn’t have made a better shot if I had been
in your place,” the scout answered. “He’s dead, all
right, and a good riddance to bad rubbish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were on their way back to Wild Bill and the
Comanches when they heard a groan. It emanated
from some person not many feet from them. “Who is
it?” whispered Buffalo Bill, while Sybil Hayden
clutched his arm tightly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hayden,” was the hoarse reply. “I ran against a
root, and fell and hurt my head. Is Sybil safe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, father,” the girl answered, as she ran forward
and knelt beside the colonel. “I am without a
scratch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment a wild commotion arose in the valley,
not one hundred yards away. The air was pierced
with shots and yells, and it was evident that a fierce
fight was in progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was over when the king of scouts reached the
open space beyond the grove of trees. The Apaches
who had planned to bushwhack the Comanches had
themselves met with a surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Of the band that had stolen silently up the valley,
but three escaped, and these were never again seen in
the Hualapi Mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>But one Comanche was killed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was not surprised to hear that Alkali
Pete had done his share in the work of extermination.
The lanky plainsman had exposed himself more than
once, but he seemed to bear a charmed life, and had
come out of the fight without a wound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only one enemy to attend to,” said Wild Bill, after
he had heard the story of Sybil Hayden’s adventure.
“Flag-pole Jack is in the castle, but we will get to
him by the way of the tunnel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him go,” urged Sybil. “You have done
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill would have made reply had not one of
the Indians detailed to watch the tunnel come up as
the girl ceased speaking. He had a report to make,
and Wild Bill looked pleased when it was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was short but important. Flag-pole Jack had attempted
to escape through the tunnel, and had been
shot and killed as he was crawling out of the long hole.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All’s well that ends well,” said the colonel joyously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The white contingent of the force that had routed
the Apaches slept that night in the castle, and next
morning left for the desert and the civilized places
beyond.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill resigned his position as acting leader of
the Yelping Crew.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colonel Hayden and his daughter went on to the
military post in Wyoming. They parted with Buffalo
Bill, Wild Bill, and Alkali Pete at Laramie.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>What was said and done at the parting left the
two scouts blushing like schoolboys.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kissed me, kissed me,” murmured the lanky plainsman,
as he walked away with the king of scouts.
“Didn’t she know’t I’m a married man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your status as a husband cut no ice with her,
Pete. It was purely a matter of generous sentiment.
Tell your wife, she won’t be jealous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ye don’t know her, Buffler. This aire is one o’
ther things I’ll shore keep ter myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a pleasant twinkle in his eyes as he rubbed
his cheek.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon their arrival in Laramie, Buffalo Bill received
orders to proceed at once to Fort Grant. Alkali Pete
elected to remain at Laramie, but Buffalo Bill and
Hickok pushed on to Fort Grant, where they met with
old Nick Nomad and Buffalo Bill’s Indian pard, Little
Cayuse. From Fort Grant the outfit hit the trail
for Skyline, where their services were needed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man who answered to the names of Tom Conover
and Toltec Tom squared his drooping shoulders
and stood up more sturdily on his shaking legs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he said to the man who asked him to have a
drink at the bar of a cheap saloon near by, “I’ve cut
it out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tempter laughed skeptically, and Conover
lurched past, his face flushing to a deep red.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was already flushed and somewhat swollen from
the effects of alcohol. High on the forehead was a
scarlet nick—a three-cornered scar—extending well
up into the hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover pulled an old brier pipe and a handful of
loose tobacco from a side pocket of his corduroy coat,
filled the pipe and thumbed the tobacco down in the
bowl as he went on, his hands trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’ve cut it out—for good!” he muttered. “I’ve
been a fool for the past month, but I won’t be any
longer. I’ll straighten up and be a man again, if I
can, and then I’ll get back to God’s country. No
more of this for me—I’ve had enough of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped, at the foot of the street, and swept
a glance over the town and surrounding country, at
the little, sunburned valley below, and the ragged hills
beyond rolling away into higher and higher elevations,
which were rimmed in and ringed by scarred and splintered
mountains. The sight of those mountains depressed
him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The view of the town was not more prepossessing.
It was a straggling mining camp, without beauty of
outline or architecture. The houses were cheap affairs,
half of them on the main street being saloons or
gambling dens where the miners from the mountains
spent their hard earnings riotously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sick of it,” he said, “and I’m goin’ to git out
of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time he lapsed into a hint of the dialect
to which he had so long been accustomed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again he looked at the desert reaches of the scarred
mountains, where it would seem that even a crow
would have hard picking to get a living.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he took from an inner pocket of the old
corduroy coat a single playing card—the queen of
hearts; and he looked at it, with a strange emotion
showing in his puffed and scarred face as he passed on
down the slope.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was soon at the edge of the town, though cheap
Mexican houses, chiefly of mud, stretched on still
farther. Before the doors dark-faced children played
in the dust, and now and then from some deep window
was visible the swarthy, Indianlike face of a
Mexican woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where a mesquite tree grew at the side of the road
he stopped. No house was near, and he sat down on a
stone, dropping heavily as if tired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though he had sturdily refused a drink that morning,
his mind was not yet relieved of the effects of
recent potations. For a month he had been on a
“spree,” and the results showed in his face and general
appearance, and still more in the workings of his
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>He held the playing card out before him and looked
at it steadily, clutching it in one trembling hand, and as
he did so tears came into his red eyes and trickled down
his swollen cheeks. To a certain extent they were
maudlin tears, yet they testified to a real and deep
emotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The queen of hearts,” he said; “the only picture
I’ve got of her—ever had of her; it don’t look like
her, yet it makes me think of her. And I don’t want
to think of her no more; it’s bad business, and it don’t
do me no good. It’s what set me to drinkin’ and howlin’
round like a locoed Injun. I reckon I played the
fool ginerally and made a swath-wide nuisance of myself.
But no more for me—this is the end of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rising, he stepped up to the mesquite tree and
pinned the card to it; then he went back and sat down
again on the stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>After staring at the card a while he drew out his
revolver and began to shoot at it. His hand was unsteady
and his first shot went wide, but the next cut
through the middle of the card.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s dead, and the past is dead, and now I’ll kill
even the memory,” he muttered. “I’ve hung to that
card a long time, and it was all I had that suggested
her; now even that goes. I don’t want to think about
it any more. I didn’t treat her right, and she didn’t
treat me right; and—but what’s the use o’ thinkin’?
It’s all gone, and dead; and she is dead; and here goes
the only thing that’s left to remind me of her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again his revolver cracked spitefully in the clear
air of the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bullet nicked a hole in the forehead of the
picture.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>He stared at it, his face paling a little.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just where I got the lance head of old Fire Top that
time,” he said. “That was a stem-winder—wonderful
that it didn’t finish me! If it was that old heathen
who was dead, instead of her! But he’s still livin’
to do more meanness in the world. Yes, I wisht it
had been him; or that this card was his ugly, painted
mug that I’m shootin’ at. He wouldn’t be waitin’,
though, for me to set here and plug him like this; he’d
be doin’ something himself, like he did before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His revolver swung between his knees, in his right
hand. With his left he touched significantly the scarlet
scar on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>But for that disfiguring scar and the marks of dissipation
revealed so plentifully in his countenance,
Tom Conover would not have been a bad-looking man.
There was a week’s growth of stubble on his face, but
with that cut away, his features would have been
comely enough. His eyes were of a steely blue. They
were watery now, but normally they were keen and
farsighted—the eyes of a man long used to looking on
the vast reaches of the mountains and deserts, where
for so many years he had made his home. He was
tall and straight, too, with a symmetry of form which
his recent debauch, and the baggy clothing he wore,
could not wholly hide. As for his years, he was probably
fifty, or near it; and his hair was tinged with
gray. It had been black, and round the edges of that
livid scar it still showed black, thrusting the scar out
by way of contrast, so that it seemed to stand forth
as vividly as a cattle brand.</p>

<p class='c007'>His face hardened as he touched the scar with his
finger and old memories swept over him, and once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>more he looked off at the serrated mountains against
the sky line. A notch there drew and held his gaze, and
in imagination he traveled along it, by way of a trail
he knew well, far into the ragged range.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been strange doings in some of the valleys
of those mountains, and he had taken part in them.
His mind began to fill with unpleasant pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>He frowned as they trooped in on him; then, snatching
up his revolver, he fired again at the queen of
hearts. Shot followed shot in roaring succession, until
the revolver was emptied and the playing card was
torn into shreds.</p>

<p class='c007'>His fusillade drew Mexicans to the doors of their
huts and shabby jacals. The playing children scampered
out of the street dust and out of sight. There
were also cries of indignation, and of fear, together
with some sharp commands laid on him to desist.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he only laughed with unnatural recklessness and
gayety as he proceeded to empty his revolver and shatter
the card.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the last cartridge was spent and the card hung
but a thing of shreds, he got up from the stone, pulled
the remnants of the card from the trunk of the mesquite,
and ground them out of sight into the deep dust
of the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bullock carts will make a finish of it, if I
haven’t,” he said, as he looked at the hole his heel had
gouged. “And now maybe I can git away from them
old memories. When I go back East I want to be another
man—a new man altogether, and I don’t want
to think even of the things that’s happened out here.
I was in the wrong, of course; but not all in the wrong.
And I don’t want any more gold—I mean any more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>hunting for gold, or nothing. I jest want to git away—away—away!”</p>

<p class='c007'>His voice rose.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of this outburst, as he turned about, he
became aware of a commotion in and about the huts
and jacals, and in the road which led to the town.
Mexican women were shrieking and wailing, and the
voices of Mexican men rose in curses in the local
patois. Some of the men were issuing from the huts
in a threatening manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what’s up?” said Conover, staring. “My
shots have been scaring these greasers, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He laughed harshly, and turned toward the town,
having thrust his revolver out of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the men issuing from the huts now dashed
up to him and sought to lay hands on him. He threw
them off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s up?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of them drew a knife and sprang at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He laughed again, bitterly this time, and, catching
the little Mexican by the arm, he twisted the knife out
of his hand and threw it into the roadside chapparal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no!” he said. “I don’t let any pig-eyed
greaser stick his dirk into me. What you want?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Diable!</span></i>” the man grunted, picking himself up and
making a dash for the tall, shabby American, naked-handed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover again threw him off, as easily as he would
have hurled aside the attack of a child.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was aroused now, and his appearance had
changed. Though his face was still puffy and his eyes
watery, his tall form straightened into sinewy outlines;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the trembling, too, had gone out of his hands
and arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You devil!” he said to the fallen man. “Keep off,
or——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked up the road toward the town, where a
crowd had appeared, a crowd which increased in numbers,
and was led by a man Conover knew to be the
town marshal.</p>

<p class='c007'>With one eye on the howling Mexicans, who were
trying now and then to get at him, Conover stared at
the advancing crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s Ben Woods want? Coming for me, is he?
Well, that’s queer! They don’t pull a man in this
town for a little shooting, as a usual thing, unless he
kills somebody; and all I’ve been potting is an old
playing card. I was a fool for even doing that—a fool
and drunk, or nigh it! A man can’t slay a memory by
shooting a card to pieces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stepped with quick stride to the side of the road,
where he had a mud wall at his back; so that he was
now able to face the Mexicans and also watch the
crowd that hurriedly approached from the direction of
the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patois of these peons was strange to him, but
he was beginning to catch words that he understood,
and slowly the meaning of what they meant filtered in.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of his bullets, glancing against a rock, had entered
a Mexican jacal and struck a Mexican woman,
injuring her severely. It was the husband of the
woman who had tried to knife him; and her brother
had run into the town and summoned the marshal with
a direful story.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal was now coming, with a posse, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>arrest the “wild American” who was supposed to be
shooting up the Mexican portion of the town. The reports
of the revolver had given point to the story of
the woman’s brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hit a woman, eh?” said Conover incredulously.
“Hit a woman when I was merely shooting at the
representation of one? Is that what you’re howlin’
about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He flung a glance at the woman’s husband, who
had crawled out and recovered the knife, and was
again trying to get where he could use it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep off!” he snarled to the man with the knife.
“If I shot a woman, it was an accident, and a fool
thing to do; but it wasn’t meant; and I ain’t goin’ to
let you drive your sticker into me because of it. Keep
off, or I’ll choke you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mexicans, gaining courage by reason of the
approach of the marshal and his men, began to crowd
Conover, gathering in a gesticulating and frantic mob
between him and the tiny Mexican huts where the
women stood and yelped like coyotes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seeing that the Mexicans were in a murderous
mood, Conover now drew his revolver, coolly thrust
cartridges into it, and, cocking it, he threatened them
with it, as he began a slow retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus retreating, he came up against the forces of
the marshal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I surrender!” he said, turning and holding his revolver
toward Ben Woods. “Whatever I’ve done was
a fool trick, and unintentional.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ben Woods, the marshal, a wiry, middle-aged borderman,
came up and took the extended revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s it mean?” he said, his men crowding in behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>him and looking curiously at Conover and the
excited peons. “You’ve had a fight down here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s reported that there was a fight, and you shot
a woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me explain,” said Conover. “You know me,
and you know that when I’ve been boozing, or coming
out of one, that I’m a fust-class fool; and not always
responsible at other times. I’d been drinking until I
got up against the Woozy-wooz.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean you’d had the D. T’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I mean; I didn’t just have ’em, but
mighty near it. I would have, if I hadn’t stopped.
And the stoppin’ was almost worse than goin’ on.
You know how ’tis; you’ve seen lots o’ the boys that
way. Well, them’s me; and I was nighabout crazy, I
reckon. But I’d cut the stuff out, and meant to stay by
that resolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I ambles down here a while ago feelin’ about as
good-humored with myself and the world as a she-wolf
that’s lost her cubs. And because I was nervous,
and didn’t know what to do with myself, I began to
shoot at a target. It was a card that I had stuck up
on that mesquite; if you’ll look at the mesquite you’ll
see where some o’ my lead plunked into it while I was
shooting. I wasn’t shooting at anybody, nor dreaming
o’ harmin’ anybody.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then these wild men jumped out at me, slingin’
their crazy lingo; and I’ve just waked up to the discovery
that some o’ my lead must have went astray.
They say I hit a woman. It’s the first time for me,
Woods, and I’m sorry if it’s so. I didn’t know it,
and didn’t mean it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Ben Woods looked at him intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That sounds straight, anyway,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s the truth, and the whole truth!” asserted Conover.
“What would I want to be shootin’ a Mexican
woman for, anyhow? Ask these chaps if the woman
wasn’t in her house? I never seen her, and she must
have been.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal turned to the Mexicans.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was the woman in her house?” he demanded
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>They pressed forward and began to make excited
statements; yet out of what they said he managed to
extract the confession that this was so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There wasn’t any crazy shootin’ up of this part
of the town, then?” he said. “It was reported there
was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mexicans clamored about him, declaring that
the woman was dying, and demanding the immediate
punishment of the man who had shot her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if he didn’t shoot at her, and hadn’t any intention
of hittin’ her?” said the marshal, trying to lull
the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>They still clamored.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woods turned from them to the man who was now
his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This thing will have to be looked into, anyhow,
Conover,” he said regretfully. “If the woman dies
it may make trouble for you. But we’ll hope she’ll
git well. Anyway, I don’t see but I’ll have to take
you to jail until the thing can be looked into.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His tone was almost an apology, and Conover understood
it as such.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deep flush, accentuating the liquor-red of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>face, noticed once before that morning, came again;
his blue eyes contracted and narrowed; for a moment
he looked defiant, his hand dropping toward the revolver
pocket hidden by the corduroy coat. He forgot
for the instant that he had surrendered the weapon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then his mood changed, and he laughed, a harsh
sound that had no merriment in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, all right, Woods!” he said. “Just as you say.
I wouldn’t shoot a woman—not even a Mexican one;
I ain’t that kind, and you know it. I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stepped forward, almost as if pushed by the
yelping Mexicans who crowded his heels; and the marshal’s
men surrounding him, he was led away into the
town, and cast into the town jail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hard luck!” he said, when the marshal’s men were
gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked disconsolately about his cheerless quarters—a
narrow room, dingy and disreputable, with one
high, barred window, and a heavy, barred door. It
held nothing but a broken-legged stool and a shaky
wooden cot on which was a tattered government
blanket and a makeshift of a pillow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dunno as it’s any use,” he muttered when he finished
his survey. “I intended to try to be a decent
man, and here I am. When a man’s down, even Fate
kicks him. I didn’t even know there was such a creature
in the world as that Mexican woman, but one of
my bullets goes huntin’ for her, and finds her; and it
lands me here. And if she dies——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shrugged his shoulders and dropped to a seat
on the cot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It come about, of course, all of it, because that
other woman died; that got me to thinking again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>then I got to drinkin’ to keep from thinkin’. I’m all
sorts of a fool, on general principles, and when I go
to loading up with liquor I’m even a few more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Restlessly he got up from the cot, and, putting the
broken stool against the wall, he mounted it, and
looked out from the barred window.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first his gaze took in the town, and particularly
that portion which held the Mexican huts. He could
even see the little mesquite tree where he had stuck up
the queen of hearts and fired at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following the road which ran there, he looked off
toward the ragged hills and the mountains looming
beyond them, his thoughts bitter.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he did so, he became aware that horsemen were
approaching the town along that road.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood on the stool staring at them until they
came up to the Mexican huts and on into the street
which led to the center of the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>The horsemen broke into a canter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Injuns,” he said, “and three white men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He strained his eyes to make them out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly a low whoop broke from his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buffalo Bill, or I’m a sand hog!” he exclaimed,
striking a palm against the bars of the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>He rubbed his eyes, and looked again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the two white men with him are Wild Bill
and that old trapper they call Nick Nomad. Whoop!
I reckon the Injuns aire some o’ Buffalo Bill’s scouts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A change passed over his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But mebbe they won’t help me. When Fate kicks a
man she kicks him hard. Yet there was a time when
Buffalo Bill and me were pards. But that’s long ago,
long ago.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE STORY OF QUICKSILVER JOHN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Ben Woods, the marshal of the town of Skyline,
met Buffalo Bill and his pards and followers in front
of the principal hotel of the town.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hotel piazza was filled with “prominent citizens,”
as a sort of welcoming committee backing the
efforts of the marshal, while people of lesser importance
filled the street on each side of the hotel and
backed against the opposite buildings in a curious
wave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill’s arrival in the town had been hourly
expected, and had been watched for from the “lookout”
station on the hotel roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as his coming was announced the news was
sent flying throughout the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woods stepped down from the piazza, extending to
Buffalo Bill his thin, wiry hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It seems like you’ve been a long time coming,
Cody,” he said, “but we’re glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He flung commands at some Mexicans grouped
near.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pedro, Sebastian—you fellers git a move on, and
take the hosses—what ye staring at? Yes, them’s
Injuns with the gentlemen! Didn’t ye never see any
before? Well, you’ll have time to git acquainted later.
Take the hosses and hustle ’em to the stables.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mexicans flew to obey.</p>

<p class='c007'>The citizens on the piazza swarmed down behind
the marshal, and the next moment Buffalo Bill and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>pards were being given a characteristic greeting of the
border.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Any word about the child?” the great scout asked
of Woods, almost before the greetings were finished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a thing,” said Woods. “We’re reckoning that
Injuns took him; that’s what we got, from the little
of the trail we could follow; though why they would
do it, or what they would want with the boy, puzzled
us, until——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped to present another “prominent citizen,”
who had just arrived in breathless haste and desired an
introduction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving Wild Bill and old Nomad to converse with
the group on and about the piazza, Buffalo Bill accompanied
Woods into the hotel, as soon as he could
do it without offense to the assembled people.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve sent for the kid’s father and mother,” said
Woods, “and they’ll be here in a little while, I reckon.
It’s a curious case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“From the report I received, it is. You were about
to say something a while ago, but stopped to introduce
that gentleman?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes; I was sayin’, I believe, that the whole
thing tangled us all up. But I heard somethin’ this
mornin’ which, maybe, is a clew. And, by the way, I
just now arrested and jailed the feller that give it to
me. Mebbe you know him? It’s Tom Conover, old
Toltec Tom, some call him, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shot a woman?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it was by clear accident, so he says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is she much hurt?” was the scout’s interested
query.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m hopin’ not, but we ain’t goin’ to be too rough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>on any white man for a thing like that, especially if
’twas an accident.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill settled back in the chair he had taken.
He and Woods were in the hotel office; but the clerk
had gone out on the piazza, and was listening there to
the talk of old Nick Nomad and Wild Bill. The
trapper’s heavy voice, uttering characteristic exclamations,
floated in at the window, accompanied by the
comments of some of the citizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on,” said Buffalo Bill to the marshal. “Tell
me about the child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you know the story?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not clearly. I was not at Fort Grant when your
messenger arrived; so what I know I received at third
hand, from the commander there, on my return. But
he said that word had come from here of the kidnaping
of a child by Indians, and he ordered me to report here
and see what I could do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that’s straight, and nearly the whole of it.
It’s Bill Morgan’s boy, down at the foot of the hill
over there. They live beyond the town, ye see, and
so it was an easy job for the reds to sneak in and do
their work, particularly as no one was thinkin’ of such
a thing, and the kid was allowed to play round outdoors
all he wanted. I’ve sent for Morgan and his
wife, so’s they can tell you all about it, and jest how
it happened; but that’s all they know, or any one does,
unless it’s Tom Conover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He produced some cigars and passed them to the
scout, as if the matter under consideration called for
such care that haste would be its ruin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks!” said Buffalo Bill, accepting a cigar in
the spirit in which it was offered.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Woods struck a match, which he held out for the
scout’s use, lighting his own cigar from it after the
scout’s was going. Then he settled back in his chair
with quite as much deliberation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before he went on with his story the clerk of the
hotel returned to the office, and some other men came
in at the clerk’s heels. They ranged themselves by
the bar, where one or two of them called for liquor,
which the clerk dispensed from a long-necked, black
bottle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What Tom Conover told me maybe amounts to
something,” said the marshal, “and maybe it don’t;
but you’re entitled to know it, and it may help. It’s
this: About twenty or thirty years ago, he said, a
child was missin’ in jest about this same way. Skyline
wasn’t standin’ here at that time. The kidnapin’
was done south o’ here, at the old ’Doby Wells, where
a settler had pitched his shack and was trying to live.
Injuns swung down from the mountains and run off
with the kid; they didn’t massacree, nor burn the
house, nor they didn’t make any ginral raid; they jest
snatched up the kid and hit the trail for the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what became of the child?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if anybody knows, I don’t; Conover didn’t
seem to. He jest remembered that. But he said he
recalled that when it was done there was talk around
to the effect that every twenty or thirty years them
hill Injuns did a trick like that; what for I don’t know,
and I reckon nobody don’t. My idea, though, if I was
put to it, is that if the thing ever really happened, it
was for a sacrifice of some kind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The scout smoked in silence as Woods talked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“Anything else?” he said, when Woods stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s about all; only Conover was inclined to
the theory that it was the work of old Fire Top, and
so was we; I mean this present case was the work
of that old heathen, we thought. Why he thought
it I don’t know, and he never said. He’d been boozing,
as I’ve told you, and whether he really knowed
what he was talkin’ about or not I can’t say. But
there you have it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What else?” the scout asked again, when the marshal
once more subsided behind his cloud of smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon there ain’t anything else, that I know of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you think it was the work of old Fire
Top?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, from the fact that a red who was supposed to
be one of Fire Top’s bucks was seen sashayin’ round
Morgan’s place the day before, and from what Conover
told me this morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You found a trail?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not a very plain one; but there was pony tracks
behind the knoll below the house—tracks of an unshod
Injun cayuse—which must have been made about
the time the kid disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You followed them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the point where they entered the main trail
leadin’ toward the Cumbres. We couldn’t do nothin’
after that, for the main trail is hard as flint, with a
thousand tracks, if there’s one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You might have made sure that the cayuse tracks
didn’t leave the Cumbres trail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We tried to, but we didn’t find nothing—except
this.” The marshal put his hand in his pocket and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>drew out a battered piece of silver that had been rudely
fashioned into an Indian earring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoever wore that was most likely an Indian,”
he said, “though it might ’a’ been a Mexican; they’re
all alike in wantin’ to wear shiny things in their ears
and in their hair—Mexicans aire half Injun, anyhow,
ye know. One of my men picked that up below the
knoll, as we was follerin’ that cayuse trail; and I
put it in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you send a force toward the Cumbres Mountains?”
queried the scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, not all the way,” said the marshal, twisting
uneasily in his chair, for he knew that was a thing
he should have insisted on. “I couldn’t git any men
that wanted to go farther than the Cross Timbers.
Fire Top’s Toltecs ain’t men that aire to be fooled with,
and so I didn’t go beyond that point. But I didn’t
see any need, as we’d struck no trail. And if it was
Fire Top, and he got into the Cumbres, where he holes
up, then it wouldn’t do no good, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why?” said the scout quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal tried to laugh, but failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Cody,” he answered, “if you want to go into
the Cumbres, and up to Fire Top’s headquarters there,
you’re welcome to; but not for me, or any one I could
git here to trail after me. It never was done but
once—by any one that came back alive; and that was
when Quicksilver John blundered down there by mistake,
and got out again by mistake. It wasn’t courage,
but luck, that brought Quicksilver John out of there
that time, I’m telling you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He settled back again, and tried to hide his confusion
by “smoking up.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“Maybe you don’t know about Quicksilver John and
that little adventurer, Cody? You wasn’t in this section
at the time, and I don’t think it has ever got into
print, so you’re pardoned for not knowin’ anything
about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quicksilver John was huntin’ for a cinnabar lode,
as usual, and he hit into the Cumbres, takin’ nothin’
but a burro and his tools and his water bottle and
grub. It’s a desert country, and he had a hard time
straight from the start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He didn’t know anything about Fire Top nor them
wicked Toltecs of his, and so wasn’t figurin’ on trouble
from that quarter. He didn’t find any cinnabar,
but he struck the queerest Injun town that any one ever
heard of, or dreamed of; it had reg’lar houses, somewhat
like them cliff dwellers’ houses you’ve seen, or
maybe read about. But some was better—some was of
stone. It was a bang-up place, for an Injun city, he
said; and he was wonderin’ whether it could really be
Injuns livin’ there, or some settlement of whites he
had never heard of, when the queerest thing happened
you could ever imagine. I dunno whether to believe
it or not! But Quicksilver John said that while he
was studyin’ them houses, a big eagle, that he hadn’t
even see, flapped down out of a tree behind him and
struck him between the shoulders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He was layin’ at the time on the edge of a precipice,
lookin’ down; and the blow of the eagle knocked
him over the edge, so that he began to fall. But,
so he reported, the claws of the eagle had got fast in
his clothes, and that kept him from dropping down like
a shot; the eagle tried to fly with him, and that held
him up a bit, though his weight kept pullin’ the eagle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>down and down. He was too heavy for the eagle to
carry; but at the same time the efforts of the eagle
to lift him up kept him from droppin’ swift. So together
they came right down into that queer town,
nighabout in the middle of it, the eagle flappin’ his
wings and screechin’, and him swinging his arms and
legs and yellin’. It must have been a queer sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And it was that way they landed, clost by some
Injuns, that wore red feathers in their hair, and was
otherwise ’most naked, except for a lot of gold bracelets.
When the ground was struck the eagle managed
to pull its hooks out of the clothes of Quicksilver
John, and to fly off; and there he was left,
sprawlin’.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, them red-feathered Injuns swarmed round
him prompt, and whooped and hollered; and they
picked him up and carried him off to some kind of
a temple, where there was a great howdy-do about it.
And then a priest, or a king, or somethin’, come;
Quicksilver John didn’t know who, or what, for this
priest, or king, or whatever, was all veiled, and wore
a robe of some kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, anyway, after Quicksilver John had been held
some days, and expected to be killed every minute,
he was carried up to the top of the cliff from which
the eagle had knocked him, and told to git.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal stopped and puffed at his cigar, which
had nearly gone out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And then,” he said, breathing deeply and blowing
out the smoke, “you can bet he got—he skedaddled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the men who had come in and heard the
story, laughed; they had heard it before, and saw only
its comedy elements.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“I reckon you don’t believe that story, Cody,” remarked
Woods, glancing at the scout. “It’s a purty
stiff yarn, and I dunno as I believe it myself. But
what Quicksilver John wanted to tell it for, if it was
a lie, gits me; he didn’t gain anything by it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He told it for the same reason that makes a man
like to tell the biggest fish story,” said some one in
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He said,” went on the marshal, “that the Injuns
was Toltecs, and was under that old coyote called Red
Feather, though whether Red Feather is livin’ or dead,
or anything much about him, nobody knows. Maybe
there ain’t any old Fire Top, and no such queer Toltecs
in them hills; but there aire Apaches there, and
that’s enough for me. Wherever there aire Apaches I
keep out. Sabe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hesitated, and went on:</p>

<p class='c007'>“But Toltec Tom says there is, or was, a chief
called Fire Top; and Injuns wearin’ red feathers have
been seen round here, and they’re said to be Toltecs,
and live in them Cumbres Hills. But that’s all we
know, Cody; maybe all that anybody knows. Except
that this kid is gone—seems to ’a’ been stolen—and
we found Injun pony tracks, and this Injun earring, or
nose ring, or whatever it is.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And so, after talkin’ the thing over, when we
couldn’t do anything, or very much, ourselves, we sent
that messenger to Fort Grant, askin’ for your help;
and here you aire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed mightily relieved that this was so.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE STOLEN CHILD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Before Buffalo Bill could comment on the queer
story of Quicksilver John, or on any of the other
things which the worthy marshal of the town of
Skyline had imparted to him, there was a sound of
scraping feet beyond the door, in the direction of the
piazza, and a man and woman came into the office.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal jumped to his feet when he saw them,
and the scout also rose, knowing that here were the
father and mother of the child that had been supposedly
stolen by Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man was a sturdy-looking fellow of the miner
type, about thirty years old. The woman was younger
and girlish, and was a beauty. Her skin was fair,
her eyes a bright blue, her hair a gold-brown; so that,
altogether, she had, in spite of the poorness and simplicity
of her clothing, something in her appearance
that suggested one of Titan’s pictures of angels.</p>

<p class='c007'>So fair and girlish, though a wife and mother, she
was, that Buffalo Bill could not, as he came to his
feet, repress a look of admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These are the people I told you about,” said
Woods, introducing them. “This is Morgan and
Missus Morgan; and it’s their kid that has disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The blue eyes of the woman filled with tears as she
looked up at the tall and handsome scout who stood
before her; his kind and kingly looks warmed her
heart, and gave her a feeling of confidence even before
he spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>As soon as the introductions had been put through
by the marshal, Buffalo Bill began to ask Morgan and
his wife questions, finding them intelligent and eager
to impart all the information they possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He”—she referred to the child—“was playing out
of the knoll when it happened. He played there nearly
every day when the weather was good, and it’s been
mostly good lately. I didn’t hear him cry out, or anything,
but I did hear the hoofs of a horse out there
somewheres, though at the minute I didn’t think anything
about that in particular. But somehow I got uneasy
by and by, and went to the door and called him.
And when he didn’t come I ran out there—and he was
gone!</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good distance off, in the direction of the Cumbres
trail, was a cloud of dust; but I couldn’t see what
was in it. For a minute I was that scared I couldn’t
hardly do anything. I ran all round, looking for
him; and then I ran to the neighbors; though maybe
I ought to have done that first.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then one of ’em told me that the day before she
had seen an Indian riding along there, with a red
feather in his hair, and a blanket on him, which she
hadn’t thought much of at the time, as Indians come
often into the town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not the Red Feathers!” interrupted the marshal
of Skyline.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know what Indians they are, and the
woman didn’t know that he was different from any
others; but when I told her about the cloud of dust,
she said at once it was probably an Indian done it,
and told me about the one she’d seen the day before,
with a red feather in his hair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Then Mr. Jones—that’s her husband—he ran into
the town here and reported it, and after that a lot of
men tried to follow the Indian, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>She stopped with a pathetic break in her voice, and
looked at Buffalo Bill, tears showing in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How old was the child?” the scout asked, mildly
and kindly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fi—five years old!” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A boy, I believe you said?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She assented by an inclination of her head, and put
her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If what Toltec Tom said was so,” put in the marshal,
“the kid that was stolen by the Red Feathers
thirty years ago was a girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman fumbled in the bosom of her dress and
drew out a photograph.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s his picture,” she said; “taken two months
ago, when we was visiting down in Madgeburg.
Everybody says it looks like him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill studied the photograph, seeing there
a bright-eyed, handsome little fellow in semisailor
clothing, a smile on his lips, as he looked straight out
at the beholder and stood up sturdily on his well-formed
legs. His long hair fell down on the collar of
the sailor suit, and was, in front, cut square off across
his well-rounded forehead. It was the picture of an
attractive, cheerful, healthy boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you think of anything else it may be important
for me to know?” said the scout, as he handed
back the photograph.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will try to find him?” she asked tremulously.
“I can’t think of anything else. Only, I have
been hearing such awful things; and the Indians are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>so cruel and terrible, and he’s such a little fellow, and
so good and dear. Do you think they will kill him—have
killed him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t think they have killed him!” the scout declared
with emphasis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you think you can find him?” she quavered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mrs. Morgan, I and my friends stand ready to do
everything that can be done in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the delay!” she urged. “I have heard some
awful talk—about how the Indians sacrifice children,
and torture them, and all that. It’s breaking my
heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She began to cry; and in her nervousness it seemed
that with difficulty she restrained a desire to clutch
hold of the great scout and thrust him out of the
office, and on the trail, in pursuit of the abductors of
her boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, understanding her feelings, said all that
he could to quiet her and give her the comforting
warmth of hope. He repeated that he would take the
trail with his aids and run the Indians down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will begin at once?” she urged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he answered; “as soon as I can get ready
for so long and dangerous a trip.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be long—very long?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She wanted her boy rescued instantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They have probably retreated deep into the Cumbres
Mountains,” the scout told her. “We shall have
to follow them there; and it will be a dangerous journey,
for which we shall have to make preparations. It
is an unfamiliar country to me, and my companions,
too, and we may need to look for a competent guide.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll get none here, Cody,” said the marshal;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“you couldn’t get any man here to follow old Fire Top
into the Cumbres—if it was old Fire Top.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an interruption at the door, and a man
came into the office hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was from the jail, and bore a letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Buffalo Bill,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letter was a note scrawled with a pencil on
a page that appeared to have been torn from a notebook.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Buffalo Bill opened it, he saw by the signature
that it was from the jail prisoner, Toltec Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was brief, and ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>Buffalo Bill</span>: You may remember me, old
pard, but perhaps you won’t, as we rawhided around
together a good many years ago and our trails haven’t
crossed much lately, if any. What all I’ve been doing
since then doesn’t matter. But I hear you’re in town—saw
you, in fact, as you and your friends came into
the place. I’m putting up at the Town Hotel, and can’t
say that I like the accommodations. I want to get out,
and that’s why I write you. The marshal will tell you
why I’m here, if you haven’t already heard about it.
Come over and see me as soon as you can, and we’ll
have a talk. I want to get out of this hole mighty bad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your one-time pard and present well-wisher,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Tom Conover</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“From Tom Conover,” said the scout, looking up
and addressing Woods, the town marshal. “He wants
to see me, and I’d like you to go over to the jail with
me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Woods got on his feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“All right,” he said; “that can be arranged easy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman and her husband stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll see this man who is held in jail here,” said
the scout to her, “and then I’ll make my arrangements.
Cheer up. I can promise you that we will do all that
men can do to rescue your boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook hands with her and her husband, and then
with Woods left the office and went out into the street,
where Nomad and Wild Bill were still “guffing” with
the crowd that surrounded them and the Indian scouts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TALK WITH TOLTEC TOM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buffalo Bill took Wild Bill and Nick Nomad with
him when he walked to the jail to interview Tom
Conover. The marshal went along also, as a matter
of course. Left behind, Little Cayuse and his three
Apaches retreated to the stables to get away from the
curious crowd, and busied themselves there in attending
to the horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover was pacing restlessly the narrow confines
of his cell when Buffalo Bill and his companions arrived.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal brought him out into the little room
which served as the jail office, where he found the
pards awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hard luck, Conover,” said the scout, greeting him;
“but we’ll hope you won’t have to stay in here long.
They’re getting ready to investigate that shooting, and
I’m told the woman isn’t really hurt much. I guess
it can be shown that the thing was a pure accident.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was a fool for potting away with my hardware
down by those huts,” Conover admitted; “there’s
where I was wrong. I hope you can git me out of this
without trouble; that’s why I sent for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We think we can do that,” said the scout cheerfully.
“You know my old pard, Wild Bill, I believe,
and no doubt you’ve heard of Nick Nomad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad had doubled himself up in a chair in an uncommunicative
way, and sat staring at Conover under
his shaggy brows, taking his measure; apparently the
old trapper did not like his looks any too well.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>But Wild Bill was in a different and amiable mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a few moments they discussed the accidental
shooting of the Mexican woman; after which, without
preliminary, Buffalo Bill introduced the subject
of the kidnaped boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s why we are here,” he explained. “I am
under instructions from the commander at Fort Grant
to take up this matter at once; which means, probably,
a trip into the Cumbres in pursuit of the kidnaping
redskins. You’re familiar with those mountains, I
believe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover’s puffed face took on a deeper red.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just say that all over again, Cody,” he requested,
for the purpose of getting time to think.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill rehearsed the story of the kidnaping
in all its details, so far as they were known, mentioning
what had been said about old Fire Top and his
Toltec Indians, called the Red Feathers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me what you know about old Fire Top and
his Red Feathers,” he said in conclusion, “and what
it was made you think Fire Top probably had a hand
in his present case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover was still hesitating; and after that question
was asked so squarely he did not speak for some
seconds. Once or twice he put his hand up to the
scarlet scar on his forehead, apparently not knowing
that he did it, and his hand trembled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Could I talk with you alone about this, Cody?” he
said finally.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Nick Nomad, squatting silent in his chair, shot
Conover a distrustful glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” Buffalo Bill answered, rising. “We can
go into that cell you occupied, or——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“Oh, we’ll clear out—go outside,” said Wild Bill,
also rising.</p>

<p class='c007'>But though he made the offer so quickly, he, too,
seemed not at all pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>The office was cleared, and Buffalo Bill remained
alone with the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe I’m pertickler, and I know them fellers
didn’t like it,” said Conover. “But what I’m goin’ to
say concerns that time I deserted you—flunked like a
coward, over on the Niobrara.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I haven’t forgotten it,” the scout admitted quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover glanced away at the window, as if he desired
to avoid the scout’s direct gaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Up to that time,” Buffalo Bill added slowly, “we
had been good pards.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And never was afterward,” Conover added.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right; I went my way, and you went yours.
They haven’t happened to cross since, until to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to make myself right about that Niobrara
bizness, if I can; but maybe I can’t. We was ringed
in by old Rattlesnake’s Pawnees, you know, and our
horses was hid in some cottonwoods down by the river,
and you was wounded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never forget it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wisht that I could,” said Conover. “I’ve wisht
that a thousand times since. But forgettin’ the past is
a hard bizness, as I’ve found. Well, though you was
wounded, you said you thought you could hold them
rocks where we were against the Pawnees, and for me
to sneak out and git the horses, and then make a dash
in with ’em, your idea being that maybe I could rush
through the Pawnee line up to the rocks in the darkness,
when you could climb to the back of your horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and perhaps both of us git away. It seemed the only
chance, and it was as desperate a one as any man ever
figured on takin’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll never forget it!” the scout repeated.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you’ll never forget what I did—and that’s
where the present trouble comes in; for you’ll never
feel like trusting me again. I made the sneak all right
through the Pawnee lines, but the reds were thicker
than I expected; and when I got to the horses my
courage failed. It wouldn’t, maybe, if I hadn’t been
discovered; that rattled me, and scared me, and instead
of trying to git your horse to you I simply straddled
mine and cut out, leaving you there among the rocks,
with them murderous Pawnees all round you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill nodded quietly, his face unchanged.
Conover was covered with confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But the next day,” said Conover, drawing a deep
breath, “I tried to make it right; I rode to the nearest
fort and gave the word, and troopers were sent right
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And found, when they got there, that I had fooled
the Pawnees and got away from them unaided, even
though I was wounded; and that the nest of rocks to
which you guided them was empty and the Pawnees
gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover was silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a clear case of blue funk, Cody; I was
scared, and I thought only of my own scalp lock. Of
course——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you never expected to see me alive
again?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t,” Conover confessed, “not even when I
led the horse soldiers to that spot. When I seen that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the Pawnees was gone, my thought, naturally, was that
they had rubbed you out and got away; and I believed
that until I knew better, some time later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped, and again his gaze wavered away to
the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s why I didn’t know if that note I sent you
just now would do any good; and it was the reason I
didn’t want to talk about this before Nick Nomad and
Wild Bill. I admit I ain’t proud of that record.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He still stared at the window, his face red and
puffy, the corners of his eyes twitching. The scarlet
scar on his forehead seemed redder and angrier than
ever. His confusion was painfully apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now about old Fire Top,” said the scout.
“Just what do you know about him? And why did
you think that perhaps he and his Toltecs were mixed
up in this case of child-stealing? You are called Toltec
Tom; I don’t know why. Back at the time of that
Niobrara matter you were simply Tom Conover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that’s so,” Conover admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps we can start the thing,” said the scout,
seeing his reluctance, “by having you tell me how you
got the name of Toltec Tom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was a prisoner of the Toltecs once,” was the hesitating
admission.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of Fire Top’s Toltecs?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How long were you held by them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A number of months,” said Conover, continuing to
stare at the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was in the Cumbres Mountains?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, perhaps, you can give me an idea whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>there is any truth at all in this story of Quicksilver
John, which the marshal here was telling me about.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He ran over hastily the points of the marshal’s
story of Quicksilver John.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think there was somethin’ in it,” said Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But it wasn’t all true?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Likely Quicksilver John would head the procession
of champion liars, on some points,” Conover
averred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me, in your judgment, how much of it was
truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover withdrew his gaze from the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cody,” he said, with sudden emotion, “there was
too much truth in it. But I can’t talk about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to talk about it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time in many minutes he looked
straight at Buffalo Bill; and the latter noted now that
the flush had gone from the puffy face, giving place
to a grayish pallor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There aire some things a man don’t want to talk
about, Cody, and that’s one of ’em, for me. But
I’ll say this: I done you dirt there on the Niobrara,
because my nerve went back on me; I played the coward,
and it might have caused your death, as I thought
it had, for a time. I ain’t felt easy about that, and
maybe I never will. But there’s such a thing as a man
being sorry for a thing like that, and willin’ to make
amends, if he can. That’s me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now my proposition: Git me out of this hole,
on this charge that’s against me of shooting that poor
Mexican woman, and then I’ll lead you and your men
into them Cumbres Hills, and straight to the home of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>old Fire Top himself. Why I’m willin’ to do it I ain’t
going to say, more than that. It will help me to pay
off the debt I owe you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can go straight there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No man can do that, Cody; them Red Feathers
aire always watching, as I’ve reason to know. We’ll
have to come it roundabout, some way. But I think I
can help you, and I’m willin’ to try. I’d like to feel
that I’m your pard again, and that that Niobrara debt
is paid off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pallor was going out of his face; his voice began
to harden and show a firmness that indicated a
sense of increasing manhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to stand straight up on my feet again, and
have the feelin’ that I’m worthy to be Buffalo Bill’s
pard, like in the old times. And I’ll do the best I can;
I can’t do more. I can’t tell you everything, though,
and you’ve got to trust me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The scout rose and stretched out his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I accept your offer, Conover,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And forget the past?” said Conover, as if he could
not believe it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Particularly that time on the Niobrara?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said all of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And overlook the fact that I ain’t tellin’ everything
I know, for which I’ve got reasons I don’t want to pass
over now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That, too. What I want is a man who knows
something about Fire Top and his Toltecs, and the way
to reach them. For I’m convinced that he, or his men,
stole the child. What’s your opinion of that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The stealin’ of the kid?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Yes. Why would he want to do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know; sacrifice, likely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But his voice was evasive again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But git me out of this, Cody,” he added, “and
I’ll do what I can; I’ll try to redeem myself. And
say nothing about that old Niobrara matter to Wild
Bill and Nomad. They wouldn’t understand it, as you
do; they’d think I hadn’t changed, and was ready to
desert, or lead you into ambush, and things of that
kind. Just keep that from ’em, will ye?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill nodded and stepped toward the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s all right, Conover,” he declared. “Unless
you make it necessary, I’ll say nothing to them about
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve never mentioned it to ’em?” came the question,
in a troubled tone. “For, if you have——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve never thought of speaking about it,” the scout
asserted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose you’ve had too many other things to
think about, to keep remembering a thing like that, so
long ago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re right there, Conover. Shall I call them in
now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover hesitated again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he said, “might as well, I reckon; but I’m
thinkin’ they won’t be overwell pleased to know I’m
to be not only their pard, but their guide. I could
see they didn’t like me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill, Nomad, and Woods, the marshal, were
asked by the scout to come into the office.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he laid out before them so much of the conversation
had with Conover as was needed to let
them know that Toltec Tom was to be a member of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>the party which was to hit the trail of the kidnaping
Indians and follow it wherever it went.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nick Nomad, squatting in his chair, still shot distrustful
looks at Tom Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t like his face,” he said to Wild Bill, after
the interview had ended.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?” Hickok inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see that red scar on his forrud, re’chin’ up
inter his ha’r?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; but what of it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s bad medicine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hickok laughed with light incredulity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Laugh ef yer wanter,” growled the trapper; “but
ef thet critter goes along wi’ us you’ll be laughin’
outer ther t’other side o’ yer mouth afore we sees this
hyar town o’ Skyline ag’in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rot! Why, you superstitious old gorilla, what’s
a scar on a man’s head got to do with his character?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lissen ter me,” said Nomad impressively: “Ther
fust man I ever see what had a scar jes’ like that war
a hoss thief what stole frum me ther best hoss I ever
had—old Nebuchadnezzar; and that man war hung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You hanged him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I helped to do it; I pulled hard on ther rope.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the second one?” said Wild Bill, laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ther second one tolled me inter a game of poker
some y’ars back when I war greener than I am now,
and swindled me outer everything I had, leavin’ me
on’y the old clo’es I stood in; and he’d no doubt took
them if they’d been wuth it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And the third one?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is this hyar feller that they calls Toltec Tom. Ef
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>he goes wi’ us he’ll do us; an’ that’s what he’s goin’
fer; no other reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You get worse and worse all the time, Nomad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But even you don’t like him, Hickok!” the shrewd
old fellow declared. “Thet’s ther truth, an’ yer knows
it; you don’t like ther looks of him any more’n I do.
Admit it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I admit it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, shell we let him go with us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not for us to say, Nomad; Cody is boss here,
and we’re simply trailing along with him, to help him
as much as we can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh! Waal, I’m shore goin’ ter speak ter Buffler.
He don’t know what he’s bitin’ off when he
pards in wi’ a wart hog like thet feller.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Nick Nomad spoke his mind vigorously, elaborating
to Buffalo Bill the objections he had stated to
Hickok.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the great scout was skeptical, even though, a
thing he did not confess, he had still rankling recollection
of that unpleasant incident of the Niobrara;
he said that he had agreed to take Conover along, and
that instead of being a handicap, he believed Conover
would be able to aid them materially.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the last word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever Buffalo Bill said went.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>SIGNS AND OMENS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The marshal and citizens of Skyline watched Buffalo
Bill’s party out of town with strange interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it was a suggestive and attractive sight, even
setting aside for the moment the occasion of their
going forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the lead, stirrup to stirrup, rode Buffalo Bill and
old Nick Nomad, the scout mounted on his superb
horse, Bear Paw, and Nomad astride of Hide-rack.
The contrast between the scout, with his erect, fine
bearing, and the wizened old trapper, was almost
startling. Yet no one knowing old Nomad could ever
doubt that, in his way, he was a wonderful man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad would not ride with Tom Conover, so Wild
Bill fell in at Conover’s side, and they followed right
behind Cody and Nomad.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrast here was almost as great, for Conover,
with his baggy corduroy clothing, his puffy face
and watery eyes, and the livid scar high on his forehead,
resembled no more that dashing free lance of
the plains, Wild Bill Hickok, than Nick Nomad did
Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was always something light and jaunty in
Wild Bill’s appearance, wherever he was seen. He
liked flashing bits of silver on the trappings of his
horse, and soft velvet in his attire when it could be
had; even though the attire was only that of a frontiersman
and often rough from hard usage. There
was usually a light smile on his open, fearless, almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>reckless countenance; it rested there now, as he rode
out from the town of Skyline toward the forbidding
mountains, even though he could not be sure he was
not riding out to meet death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Behind Wild Bill and Conover rode Little Cayuse,
the Piute Indian boy; and at his side one of his Apache
scouts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other two of his three Apaches brought up the
rear of the warlike procession; the four Indians silent
and grave, with impassive, dark faces; but their blankets
were new and gorgeous in color, while their clothing
was paint and feather decked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The marshal and the people of Skyline gave Buffalo
Bill’s little caravan a prolonged and rousing farewell
cheer, which Cody returned with a wave of his hand;
then the little cavalcade broke into a trot, down the
steep incline of the plain below the town, and clattered
away in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was just past midday.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only that morning had Buffalo Bill and his small
band entered Skyline; and that morning Tom Conover,
shooting to tatters the queen of hearts, had accidentally
wounded a Mexican woman and been thrown into the
Skyline jail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the good offices of the great scout he had
been released in record time; and, the preparations for
the pursuit of the kidnaping Indians being hastened,
the work for which Buffalo Bill had come to Skyline
was already begun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below the knoll back of Morgan’s, Little Cayuse and
his Apache trailers, Chappo, Yuppah, and Pedro,
picked up the track of the supposed kidnaper.</p>

<p class='c007'>To ordinary eyes the trail would not have been visible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and eyes as keen and trained as those of the white
men of the party would have made hard work of following
it; yet the three Apaches found it without trouble,
and pursued it with the certainty of bloodhounds
tracking familiar game.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Cayuse and his Apaches took the lead now,
and rode straight along at a swinging gallop on their
wiry, ponies, bending over as they rode, their eyes
searching the hard ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly Chappo drew in, and slipped like a snake
from the back of his saddleless pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he stood up he held something small and shiny
in the palm of his brown hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ugh!” he grunted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object he exhibited was a tiny red bead, of a
glowing scarlet, so that it resembled a small scarlet
berry or seed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sabe?” he said, his black eyes searching the face
of the scout, to whom he exhibited his find. “Injun
moccasin, Pa-e-has-ka; Injun kick um pony make um
go fast, and little bead fall off. Wuh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill inspected it critically; and saw that it
was a moccasin bead, for a bead of a different kind is
often used for moccasins than those used for clothing,
or for the hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right, Chappo,” he said. “What tribe—can you
tell?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No can tell tribe,” said Chappo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, too, and I shouldn’t have asked it;
for white men manufacture the beads, and all Indians
are able to get them, by purchase or barter. But do
you see anything else, Chappo?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing more at that point; though a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>mile or so farther on Little Cayuse, trying not to be
outdone by his Apaches, made a discovery that seemed
really astounding; but which probably he would not
have made first if in his desire to excel he had not
at the moment been some yards in advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The discovery seemed to indicate that they were following
the trail of a woman!</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Cayuse announced this with a grunt of surprise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Squaw trail!” he declared, something of scorn in
his tone, for he held to the Indian notion that a squaw
is an inferior creature. It did not please him to think
he had been following the trail of one; there was no
honor in it. “All same only squaw, Pa-e-has-ka.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rider whose pony they had been following had
there dismounted, for some reason, and the prints of
small moccasins were visible in the sand. The tracks
had been overlooked by the marshal’s men when they
came that way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Conover stared down at the marks pointed out
by little Cayuse, while the grip on his bridle rein tightened
and his face became suddenly an ashen gray, with
all the high color driven out of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the instant no one was looking at him; all were
staring, like him, at the small footprints pointed out
by the Piute boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill swung from the back of his horse and
carefully examined the tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The moccasins of an Indian woman,” he said; “yet
the tracks don’t seem exactly like those of an Indian.
We can’t tell though, for she didn’t walk about, to
give us much of a line on that.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Nomad drove old Hide-rack closer in and peered
down, wrinkling his brows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It couldn’t have been an Injun boy, eh, Buffler?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It might have been a boy; but he was wearing a
woman’s moccasins, if so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh! Yer right, Buffler. Yer kin see thar whar
ther fringe o’ beads an’ quills cut inter ther sand at
ther side o’ ther track; an Injun buck, er even er boy,
wouldn’t wear ther likes o’ thet, particularly when on a
difficult trail. All o’ ther female kind loves ornaments,
and sometimes it tell agin’ ’em, as hyar. Et war shore
a woman, Buffler; even an Injun boy wouldn’t wore
a thick bead an’ quill fringe like thet on the sides of
his moccasins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover took no part in the conversation, but kept
his horse back, and apparently gave scant attention to
the tracks in the sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was the subject of lively discussion, as the
trailers continued on their way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finding the spot where the trail of the woman—they
were almost sure it was a woman—entered the
main beaten trail, they kept a close watch on each side
to see when the pony tracks left it.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they found them they were much nearer the
dreaded Cumbres Mountains, and night was at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>They stopped, on finding a water hole, and went into
camp. Nothing was to be accomplished by hastening
on in the darkness. In doing that, they might miss the
trail altogether, though it seemed now to point straight
to the notch before them, which for some time they
had seen, and which appeared to lead directly toward
the heart of the Cumbres. It was the mountain notch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>which Tom Conover had stared at so hard and often
when he was shooting the queen of hearts into tatters
before the mesquite bush just outside the town of Skyline.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Conover was so silent that evening round the
hidden camp fire that it was noticeable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad spoke of it, in an aside, to Wild Bill:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thar’s two things, Pard Hickok, that don’t speak
until they’re ready ter strike—rattlesnakes an’ Injuns;
an’ now I’m addin’ a third—this hyar wart hog what
w’ars that three-cornered red nick in his forrud. Ef
you’ll take a look at it by the flickin’ o’ that match
which Buffler is recklessly usin’ this minute you’ll see
that it’s redder’n common, like ther wattles of a turkey
cock when it’s thinkin’ mischief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ve got as healthy an imagination as a kid
schoolboy,” said Wild Bill, with his light laugh.
“You’ll soon be finding a suspicious circumstance in
the fact that he eats just like an ordinary man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he don’t,” Nomad persisted; “he ain’t et a
thing this evenin’, though thar war a lot o’ good chuck
in thet war bag which Buffler opened up fer us. Thar’s
somethin’ on his mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill laughed again, skeptically.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What else, you superstitious old mummy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t go ter callin’ me names, Hickok, fer I won’t
stand it; but I’m watchin’ him constant. Ter-night I
sleeps like er cat—wi’ one eye open. An’ I dunno but
I’ll tie my scalp lock down, so’s he can’t lift my ha’r
ef I sh’d fall asleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he, too, gave a laugh; but it had not the merriment
of Wild Bill’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill talked much that evening with Little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Cayuse and his three Apache scouts. The great scout
trusted the Indians, for they had been true on many
occasions; and though they had the redskin failings,
they were faithful and marvelous trailers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal trouble with them was that they were
more superstitious and more governed by signs than
was even Nick Nomad.</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon, Little Cayuse had seen a circling
vulture close his wings and drop like a hawk shooting
downward at prey. It was bad medicine, for never before
had he seen a thing like that; it foretold disaster—some
enemy, he thought, was observing them from
the high cliffs, and would drop on them with the suddenness
of that drop of the vulture.</p>

<p class='c007'>Worse than this, Yuppah had crossed the trail of a
three-legged sage rabbit. That there might be no mistake
about it, Yuppah had slid from the back of his
pony and closely inspected the rabbit’s tracks. The
rabbit, he believed, had four legs, but for some reason
which boded ill for this expedition, it was holding up
one leg and using but three.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill tried to make Yuppah see that the rabbit
had lost a leg; that a coyote had probably nabbed it at
some time, and it had escaped with the loss of a leg,
bitten off by the snap of the coyote. But Yuppah
would not believe it; the rabbit had four legs, he said—all
rabbits have—this was a spirit, or witch rabbit,
and bad luck was sure to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night Nick Nomad tried to sleep like a cat—with
one eye open; but he failed, because he was too
tired to lie awake all the time, and the night was so
quiet it lulled one to sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one else slept soundly, except Little Cayuse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>who stood guard the first half of the night, and
Chappo, who acted as sentry the last half. Neither of
them, so they declared afterward, heard nor saw anything,
though their superstitious fears, it seemed to the
scout, ought to have been enough to keep them wide-eyed
until morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in the morning came a startling discovery, which
showed, also, that at some time in the night one of
them, at least, had been asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom Conover was gone from the camp! And no
one had known when he went.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact of his disappearance was announced by
Nomad, who awoke early, and, looking round for him,
did not find him, and had hardly expected that he
would find him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoop!” he shouted, and sprang to his feet; he
had lain down with all his clothing on. “Waugh! Me
no cumtax this. Onless, mebbe, it’s ther whiskizoos
workin’!”</p>

<p class='c007'>What whiskizoos were was a thing old Nomad had
never been able to say to the satisfaction of Buffalo
Bill or any one else. But whenever the old trapper
came company front with what struck him as much
out of the ordinary, or supernatural, or inexplicable,
then the whiskizoos had been at work. He never tried
to explain beyond that.</p>

<p class='c007'>His whooping exclamations brought Buffalo Bill
and Wild Bill out of their blankets and roused the
sleeping Indians, starting also to his feet Chappo, who
was on guard, but at the moment was squatting in a
growth of sagebrush by the camp fire, hugging his rifle
between his brown knees.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“What’s up?” demanded Wild Bill, pulling out his
revolver and staring round.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lookee thar!” said Nomad, pointing to the spot
where all had seen Tom Conover lie down for his
night’s sleep. “What is it yer sees thar, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s jest what I see, too—nothing; and Scar-face
Conover ought ter be layin’ thar, hadn’t he?
Whar is he? Call ther roll, Buffler.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill looked about, and off over the surrounding
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun had not yet risen, and a gray haze, of early
dawn, hid much of the rugged landscape from his view.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cayuse?” he called, a strange quaver in his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ai, Pa-e-has-ka.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yuppah!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Huh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Chappo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wuh!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pedro!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All same here, Pa-e-has-ka!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Cayuse and his Apache scouts lined up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The white man who was here is gone,” said the
scout shortly. “Find his trail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ai, Pa-e-has-ka.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They began to circle the camp, with heads down,
black eyes scanning the earth and rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>At once they were puzzled, if not baffled; there was
no trail of a white man’s boots leading out from the
camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wider and wider grew the circle in which they
swung, closer and nearer they bent their heads to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>At last, more than a hundred yards out from the
camp, Chappo uttered a low, triumphant whoop.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stopped, staring at the ground, and the other Indians
hastened to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill and his white companions walked out
to where the Indians were grouped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Me find um, Pa-e-has-ka,” said Chappo proudly.</p>

<p class='c007'>He pointed to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh!” said Nomad. “Thar’s his boot heel,
shore enough! But how’d he git hyar without making
tracks before this? Whiskizoos ag’in, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a word Chappo began to search the ground
in the direction of the camp, which he soon was aided
in by the other Indians. They talked excitedly, using
many gestures, their guttural words flowing so fast
that no one not an Indian could make out just what
they were saying. Even Little Cayuse, being a Piute,
could not comprehend all the words of the Apache
scouts who worked under him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill and the others, following along, saw
now what the Indians saw, but none would have seen,
probably, but for that discovery of the boot-heel mark.</p>

<p class='c007'>The owner of the boot heel, apparently, had got out
of the camp without stepping on the ground, merely
because in doing it he had stepped on a blanket laid
on the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was all plain enough, after it was understood.
A blanket had been spread down and walked on; then
the loose end of it had been flung round in front and
that walked on; with a continued repetition of this
until what was supposed to be a safe distance from the
camp was gained. The place where this blanket maneuver
was discontinued was rocky.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>When they had run back to the camp in this way,
the Apaches and Little Cayuse returned at once to the
spot where the boot heel had been discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was but one indentation; the next step had
been taken on solid rock; and after that the trail
went, as it were, “into the air”; it could not be followed
farther at that point.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh!” grunted old Nomad. “What does yer
think o’ et?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Cayuse and his Indian trailers halted and began
again their vocal gymnastics, when the trail disappeared
on the rocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whiskizoos,” said Nomad, staring about. “No
man what w’ars a red scar like Conover does kin be
honest, and from ther fust I said it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians talked of the three-legged rabbit, and
of the vulture that dropped for its prey like a hawk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Heap bad medicine!” said Chappo, deeply disturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Cayuse, inasmuch as he was the chief of the
Indian scouts, dared not, in the presence of Pa-e-has-ka,
express what he thought; but his dark face
looked troubled and his eyes were big and bright.
Buffalo Bill saw him paw a circle quickly through
the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circle, emblem of the egg, is everywhere the
“sign” of life; and life is the opposite of death. Little
Cayuse made the “life” sign, to keep away the
shadow of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>All looked off toward the Cumbres Mountains.
Scarred and splintered, the bare peaks lifted themselves
in the gray morning. The high rays of the rising
sun struck them and seemed to burn there.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>As they did so, the outline of a great black head—the
head of a giant with grizzly black hair—came into
view on the side of the nearest of the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians lifted groans of fright and horror and
dropped downward on their faces, groveling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Nomad uttered a snort of amazement, and
stared until his little old eyes popped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh!” he grunted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder and carry one!” cried Wild Bill, with biting
scorn, as he addressed the trapper. “Have a bit
of sense, will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see it? You see it, eh?” said Nomad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anybody can see that, of course; he’d be blind as
a mole if he didn’t see it. But what of it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a head—a black head—the head of a giant!
Whiskizoos!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fiddlesticks! Can’t you see, Nomad—you can if
you aren’t an idiot—that that which looks like a head
is just a big, cavernous hole in the side of the mountain,
ringed all round, where you think you see hair,
by a fringe of chaparral! The sunshine is lighting up
the rest of the mountain, but that hole lies in the
shadow, and is black. It happens—just happens—to
take the shape of the head of a negro, with bushy, or
woolly, hair. But it’s only a rocky hole, ringed round
with chaparral.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad looked again, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whiskizoos!” he sputtered. “Waugh! It’s shore
bad medicine; and the skedaddling of ole Scar-face
Conover means trouble for the hull of us, ef we go on.
I’m ready ter backtrack ter wonst.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look at it again,” urged Buffalo Bill. “The head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>is disappearing, as the sunshine creeps down into the
hole.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was true. In a little while the black head was
gone, and they could see the deep hole, with its fringe
of chaparral, clearly outlined on the mountainside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yit that don’t mean that we won’t have a heap er
trouble ef we go on,” said Nomad. “I’m fer backtrackin’
prompt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians still groveled, with their faces against
the ground, praying mightily to the spirits of the
mountains; they were in a blue funk. Three-footed
rabbits, eccentric vultures, and giant black heads on the
mountains, were altogether too much for their courage.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Seeing that his Indians were for a time useless, Buffalo
Bill took up the work of searching for the lost
trail, calling Wild Bill to his aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Probably you can’t blame Indians,” said the man
from Laramie, “but it’s enough to make a sensible
man sick, the way Nomad acts. I hope he’ll see a
whiskizoos some day, and that it scares him to death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill’s disgust over the superstitious behavior
of old Nomad amused Buffalo Bill mightily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s as useless to blame Nomad as to blame the
reds,” he said; “he lived with Indians the better part
of his life, so that naturally his mental machinery
works somewhat like that of an Indian.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The keen-eyed scout had not searched far, out on
the edge of the hills away from the lost trail, before
he made a discovery; though just what it meant he
was at first at a loss to know.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See here,” he said to his pard, and pointed to a
depression in a little hollow of loose sand that lay between
some rocks. “What do you say that is—what
made it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill took in at a glance the shape and dimensions
of the depression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ask me something easy,” he said; “it looks as if
a round stone, or, rather, an egg-shaped one, had fallen
and made that; but, if so, where is the stone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a footprint,” Buffalo Bill declared, when he
had looked farther.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“An animal’s, then; no man ever had a foot as big
as that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whatever made it,” the scout asserted, “went on
across these rocks; for you can see here where pebbles
were dislodged. This little stone was turned, too;
the thing, man or animal, stepped on the end of it,
and it flipped over as he lifted his foot and went on.
That’s clear enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was, to men trained to close observation, as they
were. The side of the small, flat, sharp-pointed stone
which was now uppermost was of a different hue from
the side that had weathered, and was now turned underneath,
and of a different hue from the other stones
about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accompanied by Hickok, Buffalo Bill went on across
the rocks, looking carefully ahead of him; for there
was always the danger of ambush, as they were now
in unknown and hostile Indian territory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trail of turned pebbles, with here and there an
overturned stone, guided them, until they came again
to a sandy depression between rocks, where once more
they discovered an oblong hole suggesting the footprint
of some large and unknown animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at the side of this footprint was a bright, new
rifle cartridge, and finger marks that were surely made
by a human hand, where fingers had obviously reached
down to pick up the dropped cartridge, but had failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill looked at this intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s plain enough,” he said; “this is the trail of
a man, who passed along here in the darkness, or,
perhaps, in the moonlight, for there was a bright moon
along toward morning. Being in a hurry, or not able
to see well, he now and then stepped into one of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>sandy hollows, and here he dropped a cartridge from
his belt, or out of his pocket, and tried to find it, but
failed, probably because in the bad light he couldn’t
see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder, and carry one!” was Wild Bill’s exclamation.
“I reckon, Cody, if you’re right—and it looks
it—the fellow is a giant. That print is as big as the
spoor of an elephant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking back, Buffalo Bill saw the three Apaches
still prostrating themselves. But Little Cayuse, remembering
doubtless that he was a chief, and possibly
ashamed of his show of fear, had withdrawn
from them. Yet he was still staring at the mountain,
as if wondering what had become of the black head.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observing Little Cayuse’s attitude, Wild Bill
laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see what it will mean, pard, when they discover
these big tracks. They’ll be sure they’re the
tracks of the giant whose head they saw over there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill had already thought of that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Nomad will be as bad,” Wild Bill added.
“Here’s a whiskizoos for him that’s worth thinking
about. What do you make out of it, Cody, anyhow?
Was the fellow who went along here a giant, or did he
have a case of deformed feet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>As it was a question that could not be answered,
the scout did not try to reply, but, standing on the
rock by the sandy depression, he signaled to Nick
Nomad to bring down the horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad was seen to shake his head lugubriously;
but he got up the horses, and began to pack the camp
kit and other belongings, after having saddled and
bridled the animals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Having seen the old trapper begin this, Buffalo Bill
went on with the work in hand, accompanied by Wild
Bill, who made a running fire of comment in low tones,
with now and then a characteristic humorous expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What about Little Cayuse and the ’Paches?”
Hickok asked after a while.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s no use to argue with them now. When he
sees the horses packed and the camp abandoned, Little
Cayuse will come on; and you may be sure the ’Paches
will trail along not far behind him, in spite of their
fears. You see, Hickok, they’ll be more afraid to stay
behind than to go ahead; to be with us gives them a
sense of protection they can’t have when by themselves.
Yet they’re not cowards; they’re simply superstitious,
and scared by their superstition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The same as Nomad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; only Nomad will listen to reason sooner than
the reds. You can see that he’s bringing the horses
down now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When they had followed the strange trail over the
rocks for some distance, finding it anything but easy
work, as at times there was not a thing to be seen and
even the direction had to be reasoned out, they came
down from the rocky hill to a stretch of sand, which
reached on in a narrow valley toward the mountain
which had shown the black head.</p>

<p class='c007'>The big tracks, seen only twice before, were here
plainer than print, where they entered and continued
on the sandy area.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fellow was no giant, anyway,” said Buffalo
Bill, looking at the big footprints.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No? How do you make that out?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“The tracks are too close together, you will observe.
We may rightly suppose that a giant with feet as big
as those tracks indicate would have long legs, in proportion,
and would take long steps; but you can see
that the steps are only about as far apart as they would
be if made by an ordinary man; in fact, either you or I
would step farther. The fellow had big, heavy feet,
or wore large and heavy shoes, that is shown by the
way he scraped his feet along, as if they were too
heavy to lift out of the sand. Right out there, I
judge, he broke into a run, from the way the tracks
look.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right, Cody!” assented Wild Bill. “You don’t
need any Apaches to trail round and play Eliza’s bloodhounds
for you; you’re fully equal to that trick yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without waiting at the edge of the sandy plain for
the arrival of Nomad and the horses, they continued to
follow the big tracks, and as a result soon made another
discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>A horse had come down out of the edge of the hills
and crossed the narrow plain here, going in the direction
of the mountain; and the man with the big feet
had apparently followed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small hoofs of the horse, and the fact that it
was unshod, told that it was an Indian pony; while
the depth to which its hoofs had sunk in the sand indicated
that it carried a heavy burden.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the two scouts were making these discoveries
and discussing them they came upon a shining bit of
metal lying in the sand. Of the shape and size of
a twenty-dollar gold piece, it was not so round. One
side, perfectly flat, showed hammer marks, while on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the other side was the rayed image of the sun. The
workmanship was Indian, without a doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indian money?” said Wild Bill, as they looked
at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“More likely an Indian ornament. Or it may be
some sacred emblem. There are sun-worshiping
tribes down here in the Southwest, you know; and I
don’t doubt these mysterious Toltecs we’re trying so
hard to visit have got a lot of sun-worship practices
and traditions. So, this has a meaning for us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This pony was ridden by an Indian, and the rider
dropped this bit of metal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s pure gold, I think.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He bit it, and tested it by ringing it against the barrel
of his rifle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s gold, all right, Cody. Maybe the pony was
loaded up with gold like it, judging by the way he sank
into the sand here. And perhaps old Giant Foot was
chasing after the Indian, to get some of the gold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill understood that his pard was making
wild and half-humorous guesses, in lieu of something
tangible to hit upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Hickok, we’ve made a beginning,” he said,
with immense satisfaction; “and now we’ll turn back
and get something to eat, and talk the thing over while
getting ready for another start. These trails go
straight toward the notch in the mountain there; we
can see that from here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And they were made last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Or early this morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this doesn’t tell us anything about Conover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Pard Cody; what of him? Why did he make a sneak
like that out of our camp?”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was not easily answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two pards met Nick Nomad at the edge of the
sand, where the old trapper had halted and dismounted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What yer goin’ ter do now?” was his querulous
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve found some trails that we’re going to follow,
Nomad, as soon as we’ve had some breakfast,” Buffalo
Bill informed him. “It isn’t healthy to begin a
hard day’s work on an empty stomach, so you may
open that war bag, while I start a fire here, and we’ll
boil some coffee and have something to eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wild Bill, looking across the slope of the hills, saw
the four Indians bunched together and staring down
at the party of whites. He waved to them, and Little
Cayuse started down the slope reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Little Cayuse was halfway down, the three
Apaches began to follow him, coming along in single
file.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just let them alone—pay no attention to them,”
Buffalo Bill advised Hickok. “They’re no good right
now, but we can work this thing out without them,
and they’ll trail along behind us rather than be left.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad was silent, getting out the food and the
cooking vessels; but what the scout stated was not lost
on him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re goin’ ter try to foller thet ole Scar Head,
Buffler?” he asked at length.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We don’t intend to trouble ourselves in the least
about him, Nomad,” was the reply. “We brought him
along for a guide, as he knows more about this section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>than any of us; but as he seems to have deserted
us, we’ll just go on without him, and let him work
out his own salvation. We’re no worse off than if
we hadn’t started with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nomad shook his head in vigorous dissent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A heap wuss off!” he asserted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s as one looks at it, perhaps,” said the scout.
He would not argue the matter with his trapper pard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yer ain’t any idee why he done it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What has yer found out thar in ther sand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill explained the nature of the discoveries
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These hyar reds seem ter be havin’ more gold and
silver than they kin well kerry, jedgin’ by ther way
they drap it,” commented Nomad, as he inspected the
gold piece which the scout showed him. “Recklect
thet silver yearring, we thought it war, which war let
fall thar by Morgan’s, whar ther kid was took, an’
now this hyar gold ornyment!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps we’ll pick up enough gold and silver along
this trail to pay us for our time and trouble,” remarked
the scout, laughing, as he put the gold piece away in
his pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Little Cayuse had reached the edge of
the small sand plain; and the Apaches, who had hurried
their steps, were right behind him. Little Cayuse
halted and looked at Buffalo Bill; apparently he expected
a rebuke of some kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Buffalo Bill chose rather to ignore what had
happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have the Apaches come in, and we’ll get something
to eat in a short time,” he said to the Piute boy. “We’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>likely have a hard day of it, and we want to start in
with well-lined stomachs. Nomad, I suppose you
watered the horses?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The trapper started guiltily, a flush spreading over
his hairy face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh!” he grunted. “Buffler, I clean fergot it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The discovery that he had been so derelict seemed
to arouse him, and he sprang with vigor to the back of
Hide-rack, and, taking the reins of the other horses;
he led them back across the ridge to the water hole,
close by which they had made their night camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he had watered the horses and returned, the
breakfast was ready, the meat roasted to a turn, and
the coffee smoking hot in the tin coffeepot.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill called the Piute and his Apaches to the
morning meal, avoiding any mention, for the time,
of the things that had so disturbed them. It was the
best course to pursue, under the circumstances. Yet
they did not eat well—their appetites were gone for
the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only when the scout ordered a forward march, after
breakfast, did Little Cayuse bring up the matter that
troubled them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Apaches say um bad medicine, Pa-e-has-ka!” he
said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill looked directly at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are the chief of these Apaches, Little Cayuse,”
he stated. “And a chief must be brave, if his followers
are to be brave. Tell your Apaches to go on
and follow the trail they will find out there. You can
see some of it here.” He pointed to the gigantic footprints.
“Out there is the trail of an Indian horse,
joining this one. Are you ready to obey orders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Cayuse, or shall I go on and leave you and the Apaches
here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>His tone was stern, for the first time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chappo, Yuppah, and Pedro looked at each other, a
shrinking expression in their black eyes; but Little
Cayuse, thus appealed to, straightened his muscular
shoulders and lifted his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ai, Pa-e-has-ka,” he said, “Little Cayuse go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He strode forth into the trail left by the big-footed
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment or two the three Apaches hung back,
talking among themselves; then Chappo followed Little
Cayuse, and the others, with shrugs of their naked
shoulders and apprehensive glances at the mountains,
went along behind him, each stepping in the tracks of
the one before, Indian fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re ready, Nomad,” said Buffalo Bill, swinging
to the big saddle on the back of Bear Paw.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nick Nomad scorned to show the white feather
where an Indian led the way. Without even a grunt
he mounted Hide-rack, and the trailing of the big
tracks and the hoofprints of the Indian pony was begun.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet though they went on, the Indians were silent and
apprehensive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The double trail led to and into the notch in the
range; then on through the notch, with the mountains
on each side growing higher and wilder. But nothing
of a startling character was seen or heard. The notch
lay in deep silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a whole day the party went on, without trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day began much the same. And they entered
another mountain notch, like the first.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>In places the way was so stony, being but naked
rock, that even the Apaches could see no marks of
hoof or footprint; but as it was so manifestly impossible
for those they were following to have left this
notch, the party continued on, reasonably sure that
when the soil was of a friendly character they would
find again the tracks they had so long followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so it came about, as they descended from the
notch into a scarred basin, which lay like a burned
cup in a niche of the desolate mountains, that the trail
was picked up again—the giant footsteps, supposed to
be those of a man, and the hoofprints of the Indian
pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>During that long ride of a day and more the three
white men talked at intervals of the mysterious disappearance
from their midst of Toltec Tom, and of
what it meant; how he had sneaked out of the camp,
hiding his footsteps by using a blanket.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing gave them food for thought—it was not
one of their blankets he had used; therefore, some one
had come to him, bringing him the blanket with which
he had hid his tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that fact they had reached the conclusion that
the reason the pony tracks sank deep into the sandy
places was because the animal carried double—bore
Toltec Tom and whoever it was who had come to his
assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who was that person?</p>

<p class='c007'>They could not guess, unless it was the Red Feather
who had stolen away the child from the town of Skyline,
and had dropped the silver earring in the trail
close by the knoll at Morgan’s. If true, the same person
had dropped the sun-stamped gold piece.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>That person, they had argued, was an Indian; and
what they had seen the previous day indicated it was
an Indian woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>But had an Indian woman, the stealer of the child,
also stolen or enticed Toltec Tom to leave the camp
in that mysterious manner during the watches of the
night?</p>

<p class='c007'>Here was a puzzle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill admitted that its explanation rested in
the future. All they could do now was to go on as
they had been doing and see what would come to
pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the things which developed was of a character
to again frighten the Indians and cause Nomad
to talk once more of the whiskizoos.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vulture seen previously, or another similar bird,
was observed to hover over the trail some distance before
them, and then close its wings and drop, like a
hawk descending on a rabbit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians went on, even after that; but when they
came to the spot where the vulture had hovered and
shot downward, and discovered at that spot, or near
it, singular bird tracks in the sand, they were thrown
into a panic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The devil bird!” said Chappo, speaking to his
companions in their own language.</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood up, wild-eyed, and repeated it to Little
Cayuse in broken English, the other Apaches,
grouped by him, shaking with renewed terror. Little
Cayuse seemed almost as much moved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill rode forward and looked at the track
of the “devil bird.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is the sand, close by the pony trail, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>marks of an immense claw of a bird, at least a yard in
diameter. Yet the keen-eyed scout soon saw that,
while a clever imitation, it had not been made by a
bird, but by human fingers tracing it in the sand for a
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>That purpose, of course, was to frighten the Indian
trailers. Which showed, also, that either the rider of
the pony or the man who made the gigantic steps knew
Indian trailers were following.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill pointed this out to Little Cayuse and
the Apaches, and argued the thing with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the Apaches only looked at him stolidly now;
they refused to go on again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yer remembers thet story o’ Quicksilver John,”
said Nomad, “and how a big eagle come an’ knocked
him off ther cliff aidge down inter ther town of them
queer Toltecs. I opine this is ther track o’ thet identickel
eagle; and it war thet we saw in sky hyar, ’stead
of a vulture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder, and carry one!” exploded Wild Bill.
“Nomad, you old weenywurst, you’re as bad as the
Apaches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ain’t believin’ in no devil bird,” expostulated the
trapper; “but yer heerd yerself about thet eagle, how
it grupped Quicksilver John in ther slack o’ his coat,
and jest lifted him gentle down off ther clift inter ther
town. Yer heerd thet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But didn’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh! I’m believin’ it, now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was still talking to Little Cayuse and
his Apaches.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay behind, then,” he said at length, losing his
patience at last; “we can get along without you!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>There’s the trail straight behind us, to the town of
Skyline; take it, and get back there as quick as you
can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He rode on, and, Wild Bill following, Nomad could
not but do the same, if he did not want to hang back
with the shrinking Indians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill did not glance back, but he had not ridden
far when the sounds he heard told him that Little
Cayuse and his Apaches were following. Their fears
would not let them retreat alone; they wanted the protection
of the white men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rounding some ridges in the sunburned valley,
where a strange mist had seemed to rise, they came
upon a number of bubbling mud springs, which
emitted, with the ocherish mud, a fetid odor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Close by these springs, and running off toward the
barren flanks of the mountains, were a petrified forest
of considerable size, but the trees were prostrate, and
some of the trunks and branches were broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were more of these mud springs, some with
bases of red, where the overflowing mud, impregnated
with that color, had built up fantastic formations.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these springs threw up its muddy jets at
regular intervals, with a whistling sound which ended
like the shriek of a madman.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally, these things only tended to make the Indian
trailers think they were being plunged now into
some inferno presided over by demons. If it had
seemed safe to run away incontinently, they would
have done so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond the valley holding the petrified trees and the
mud springs was another mountain notch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trail pointed straight into it. Buffalo Bill followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the trail. He kept his horse at a canter much of
the time, so that the Piute boy and his Apaches were
forced into a run. His object was twofold—to get
over the ground as fast as possible, and to hurry the
Indians along so quickly they would not be given time
to consider too much the apparent perils they were running
into.</p>

<p class='c007'>The notch they entered now was narrower than the
others, with steeper walls, of a cañonlike character,
and high cliffs naked and sun-seared. In addition,
many of the cliffs were banded and streaked with ocher
and vermilion, and with various combinations of
these, mixed in with duller colors. Sometimes it was
as if the cliff walls had been laid up regularly with
lines of stones of these colors. The tops were a fiery
red. And as the narrow avenue before the party
was of that same reddish hue, the general appearance
was what one might imagine to be that of a gateway
to the infernal regions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians, instead of hanging back, now kept
close to the heels of the horses, with frightened glances
cast now and then behind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Nomad was as silent as the Indians themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill did not talk much;
the rainbowed avenue, pinching in about them, had a
depressing effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh!” said Nomad, when daylight was seen
shining like a white star ahead. “I’m glad ter git outer
this hyar, anyhow. I’ll sing praises an’ shout halleluyers,
when I hears water runnin’ ag’in and sees grass
growin’.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no water and no grass, apparently,
in the region beyond this red notch. A flat basin lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>there, like the dried-up bottom of some old lake; except
that near the middle of it the bottom seemed to
have dropped out, and showed a ragged rent or hole,
with precipice edges on the nearer side and sheer cliff
walls, rainbowed, on the farther.</p>

<p class='c007'>Smoke ascended in thin columns out of that deep
hole, and though from where they were the hole
seemed small, Buffalo Bill saw that really it was very
large, covering a space of a mile or more in its widest
diameter.</p>

<p class='c007'>He drew rein involuntarily in the mouth of the
notch, and sat looking off at that hole and the smoke
columns mounting out of it into the turquoise-blue sky.
One of the columns was like mist, and much larger
than the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh!” ejaculated Nomad, drawing Hide-rack
back by a jerk on the rein. “I been lookin’ fer ther
Pit, and thar she is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill took out his field glasses, screwed them
into focus, took a long look, and passed them silently
to Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians stood wide-eyed and staring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Cayuse swung his hand through the air, making
that egg-shaped circle; it was his prayer to the
Indian spirits to give him “life,” in this dire emergency,
instead of “death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As they gazed at the queer valley and queer hole a
score or more of mounted Indians bobbed into sight
and swooped down on an object that had not yet attracted
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians were so near the end of the notch that
their painted bodies and faces, and their singular ornaments,
could be seen; likewise the tuft of red feathers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>which each wore in his hair. And their yells reached
the group in the notch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Indians swung ropes, presumably of rawhide,
and cast them at the object, which apparently had
been crouching on the ground beside a rock.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object rose into full view, and was seen to be
a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill, with the glasses again in his hands,
turned them full on the man whom the red-feathered
Indians lassoed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The baron!” broke from his lips. “Baron von
Schnitzenhauser!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thunder, and carry one!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Waugh! It cain’t be; it jes’ cain’t be, Buffler!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was no doubt about it. Buffalo Bill knew
the baron too well. There was the round body and the
slender legs, like a pippin on a pair of toothpicks; there
was the characteristic clothing; even the baron’s
frightened face could be seen distinctly with the glasses
as the lariats threw him down.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was but one thing strange and puzzling—the
shoes the baron had on his feet; they bobbed up into
full view as he fell forward under the pull of the
ropes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then even that mystery was solved; the baron was
wearing Dutch wooden shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>That explained the gigantic tracks in the sand. The
baron, wearing those monstrous wooden shoes, had
been the man following the tracks of the pony.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had reached the spot where he now was, had
been detected there by the red-feathered Indians, and
was now their prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was impossible to help him, though near enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>to be distinctly seen, he was still too far off to be
reached quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throwing him to the back of one of their ponies,
the Indians bore him off, as Buffalo Bill turned his
field glasses, for the second time, over to Wild Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Schnitzenhauser,” he said, as if it were difficult to
believe, “and captured by the Red Feathers! That’s
the Toltec town right ahead of us, in that hole, I think,
and they’re taking him there. But we can’t do anything,
just now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The only thing they could do was to watch and
wonder while the Red Feathers made off and disappeared
with their prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wooden shoes!” grunted Nomad almost incredulously.
“What war ther Dutch fool w’arin’ them fur,
somebody tell me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But no one was able to inform him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BARON AND TOLTEC TOM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Schnitzenhauser, a prisoner in the town of the mysterious
Toltecs, to which he had been taken hastily,
was met there by a white man, who visited him in the
little prison into which he had been thrown.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a marvelous prison—a gem of marble and
gold; Schnitzenhauser had never even dreamed of anything
like it, and he had been carefully inspecting it.
The bars across the narrow window seemed to be of
pure gold, though, as they were so hard and strong,
some alloy must have been used. The lock and the
key of the door, also, seemed to be gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The German was wondering if he could not in some
manner wrench those gold bars away, and, on getting
out, carry them off with him, for he hoped to escape,
and it was a sudden lust for gold which had brought
him into his present peril.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the German was testing the gold bars by
feeling of them and licking them with his tongue,
the door was opened, and the white man mentioned
came in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Red-feathered Indians were visible behind the white
man as the door swung open, but he closed the door
with a jerk, and none of the Indians offered to enter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Howdy!” he said, looking at the German.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yaw,”, said the German, staring in surprise, yet
pleased to know that a white man was in this place.
“I vass pooty goot, bud I don’t like diss chail pitzness.
How you vass yourselluf, heh?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“Set down there, and let’s have a talk,” said the
white man, motioning to a bearskin rug on the floor,
while he dropped down against the opposite wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron clattered obediently across the stone floor
with his heavy wooden shoes and dropped heavily
down on the bearskin; astonishment was growing in
his round face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You vass a vite Inchun, heh?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I’m a prisoner, like you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron twisted his head round with a comical
jerk and stared hard at the white man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ton’d loogk id, mine frient,” he declared. “A
brisoner ton’d can come unt vent vhen he likes—nein!
He is putt indo a blace like diss. Yaw, I dinks me dat
iss so, unt dhe troot. You vass come here like a vree
mans yet already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The white man, who was none other than Tom
Conover, did not laugh at this sally; his face had a
serious, grave look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It would take a good deal of explainin’,” he said,
“to make you understand all about it—how I came to
be here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bud nod so mooch, py chinks, to dell how I come
to pe here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You were captured by the Indians out on the plain
there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You pet you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was you out there for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vhat vass you here for? Dell me; unt mebbe I
opens oop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m goin’ to try to get you out of this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The German came to his feet with a clatter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“Chumpin’ raddlesniks!” he cried, his eyes opening
wide. “You vass nod makin’ shokes uff me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly not,” said Conover, with the utmost seriousness.
“I’m sorry you fell into the hands of these
Indians, and I’ll try to get you away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron clattered across the stone floor and
stretched out his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shake you der hant py for dat,” he cried; “unt
vhen he meeds me, I tell Puffalo Pill I have meed vun
vite Inchun vat iss a shendelmans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You know him?” cried Conover, amazed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do I know heem? Veil, I dhinks me so I do. I
haf his bard peen yit already. Unt I know Vilt Pill,
unt old Nomat, unt all dem odder vellers vat drail

<p class='c007'>He was shaking Conover’s hand vigorously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How does it happen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vat? Vy, he know I vass a courageous Cherman,
unt so he make me hiss bard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wasn’t with him, out there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nein! I vass py my lonesome selluf; I strike

on the bars of the window. “Das vass der glimmer vat

<p class='c007'>“So you knew there was gold here? How did you

<p class='c007'>“I tidn’t knowed id, but I guessed id. I vill exblanation

<p class='c007'>He hammered the gold bars again, clattering about
noisily with the wooden shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Noticing that the white man glanced at the shoes,
he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Der likes uff heem I vear vhen I vass a poy, in der
olt gountry. So I dhinks, vhen I blan diss drip,
vooden shoon is maype petter as leadher vuns; maype
der sand don’t purn t’rough der vood so pad as t’rough
der leadher. Unt I vass righd; id don’t. In dese I
valk all tay t’rough der hot desert uff der sands, unt
I ton’d feel id.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Conover admitted. “But
I should think they’d be so clumsy you couldn’t get
along at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Schnitzenhauser dissented vigorously, and danced
across the floor to show how light he was on his feet,
in spite of the clumsy shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Id make a heab uff tifference uff a veller peen used
to ’em,” he asserted. “Dey vass Cherman shoes, unt
I vear dhem as a poy already. It make me feel
youngk again vhen I bud dese on my feed. Yaw,
dat iss so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“About this other matter,” said Conover. “I’m told
you were following the trail of the pony that came, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>here. I didn’t see you, but that’s what the Indians reported
here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You didn’t seen me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover had made a slip, probably, but he smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I might as well tell you just how it was,” he said,
“and then you’ll have a clearer understanding. A
child was stolen from the town of Skyline. You know
where that is?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Apowet. But I ain’d neffer peen dere.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A certain woman stole that child from there, and
set out to bring it here. The Indians here didn’t
know it—didn’t know she intended to do it, though it
so nearly concerned them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vat iss? Chilt sdealin’ iss a mean pitzness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I reckon you’re right about that. But that isn’t
my story. She set out with the child, and Buffalo
Bill and some of his pards——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vat!” The German flounced round, staring. “Dit
you say Puffalo Pill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Buffalo Bill and his pards, Nomad and Hickok, set
out, with another man, to follow the trail of the person
who kidnaped the child.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“De chilt iss in vat blace?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Donderundblitzen! Id iss here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right here in this town.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Den Puffalo Pill iss caming?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He and his pards are out in the hills beyond the
town now, and the Indians are planning to capture
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mein himmel! Iss dot de troot?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, they’re out there, and I reckon the reds will
sure bag them. I’ll get to that directly, and give you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>a plan whereby maybe you can help them, if they’re
not captured before night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The other man who set out from Skyline with Buffalo
Bill and his pards had been in this part of the
country before and knew about it, and they took him
along as a guide because of it. But one night when
the whole camp was asleep, even the guards, this
woman, who had gone on with the child, and then had
turned back to see if she had been followed, entered
their camp, and awoke this man, without arousing
the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was a time when this man had been the
husband of that woman. She is a white woman, not
an Indian, and he had loved her; I don’t suppose I
could make you understand just how much he had
loved her. And he had been told that she was dead.
He had not seen her for a long time, but he still cared
so much for her that when he heard she was dead he
went on a high old drunk, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A mighdy foony vay to show he vass sorry apowet
id!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When he got over it, and cut out the liquor, he
determined to turn his back on the past and go far
away, never to come back. Yet he didn’t; he went
with Buffalo Bill, when it seemed he could do some
good; for he had come to the decision to try to do
some little good in the world hereafter, if he could.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m just telling you this so that you’ll understand
something of the way he felt when he woke up there
in the camp, and saw that this very woman, his wife,
had waked him. The moon shone, and when he first
saw her face he was sure it was her spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She beckoned and put her hand on her lips; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>got up and followed her. He couldn’t help himself—it
was as if he was in a dream, and he rather thought
it was all a dream at the time. So he did just what
she motioned him to do—stepped carefully on the
blanket she laid down for him to step on, and so,
using that to hide their footsteps, they went out of
the camp. The moon was shining bright.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At intervals the staring German uttered strange
German exclamations. Yet even then he did not understand
the spirit in which this confession was being
made; could not understand that Tom Conover felt
the necessity of telling this, explaining this apparent
desertion of Buffalo Bill, to some one. That the German
had been a pard of the great scout was really the
thing that drew it out of him; he hoped it would
reach Buffalo Bill in that way, and that he would understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I still thought I was in a dream,” he went on, “or
that I walked with a spirit. The woman had a horse,
and we both mounted it and rode away toward this
place. In a notch of the hills she picked up the child,
which she had left there when she went back. And
so we came on here. But I didn’t know you followed,
or that we had been seen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The German stared harder now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You—you vass diss mans?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The flush deepened in Conover’s face and made a
more vividly crimson the deep scar that disfigured his
forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was that man!” he confessed, almost as if he
stood convicted and abashed before this German.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mein himmel!” The German threw up his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t expect you to understand it—my feelings,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>went on Conover, “I don’t really suppose that anybody
ever can; so I’ll not try to make it plainer,
but——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron danced round the room in his excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Den id vass you,” he said, stopping short, “vat I
vollered; you unt dem vomans. You vass bot’ uff
you riting on vun horse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and you got yourself in this fix by following

<p class='c007'>“Id vass der golt she hat vat I voller—der golt on

“Golt varefer you loogk; gold door latchges. Inchins

arrow beats unt golt on der lance boints. It make me

<p class='c007'>He stopped, almost breathless.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I tidn’t see no Puffalo Pills follerin’ diss
vomans unt you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He and his pards are out in the hills now, but
they’ll be captured. I hope they will get away, but
I don’t see how they can. It’s no country for a white
man to come into.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“Yid you vass here—huh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s different.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Vy iss id tifferend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I couldn’t make you understand, but it is. You
see, I am the husband of this woman. We quarreled
and I left her, years ago, but she never forgot me,
and she doesn’t want me ever to go away again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unt you ain’d goin’ do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s not the point. I came here just to tell you
to cheer up; that I’ll get you out of this to-night, unless
all my plans fail. I’d like to get you to Buffalo
Bill, with a message from me, telling him to backtrack.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bud der chilt?” said the German. “He vouldn’t
go mitout id. Uff you vass his bard peen, you know
dot. Puffalo Pill gids all der time vat he hass came
for.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover looked troubled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is so,” he admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron faced him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dell me,” he said, “vy is diss golt vomans vant
der chilt? I subbose id iss pecause she hass god none
uff her own.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not exactly that,” said Conover evasively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She had another reason altogether.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Der chilt iss to pe kilt—saccerivized? I haf heart
uff der ligkes uff dat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not at all; it will be treated well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The baron looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m your vriend, eenyhow,” he said, striking Conover
familiarly on the shoulder, “uff you gan gid me
oudt uff dis, unt vare Puffalo Pill iss now. Der
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Inchins ton’d gid him. Nein! Puffalo Pill iss doo
smardt vor eeny Inchuns vatefer. I know him; me,
Baron von Schnitzenhauser, know Puffalo Pill petter
as he knows me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood up very straight, drawing himself to his
full height, with a clatter of the wooden shoes, and
hammered his breast much as he had hammered the
gold bars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dot iss me!” he said. “I am a prave mans, unt so
iss Puffalo Pill. You gid me oudt uff here undo vare
he is, unt I bed you ve git does chilt mighdy quick.
Likewise,” he looked covetously at the gold bars, “ve
gid so much uff diss stuff as ve can load ondo ower
horses. Olt Schnitzenhauser ain’d dead vid, huh?
Nein! You pet me dot ve—dot is me unt Puffalo
Pill—vill lif yid to make dings lifely for dese Inchuns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He held out his hand again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bud I veels sorry vor you, sure; you petter gome
mit us when ve make t’ings lively py dis town. Der
lifely pitzness vill pegin yoost as soon as I am oudt
uff here unt mit Puffalo Pill. Yaw, dot iss so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover rose a bit wearily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This gold here is heavily alloyed,” he said; “yet
it is valuable, for there is a lot of it. Those window
bars are more than three-fourths copper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had said much more than he had meant to say
about himself, but the hopelessness, even the apparent
uselessness, of trying to make this German understand
him and his viewpoint was impressed on him
deeply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The German was staring at the shining window bars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wearily Conover turned toward the door, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>had been locked from the outside after his entrance.
On the door he tapped, and the key was turned in the
lock.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by for the present,” he said, squeezing the
hand of the German. “These fellows out here don’t
understand English, so you needn’t be afraid on that
score; I know them well. And be ready for to-night.
I don’t know just how it’s to be done. But I heartily
hope Buffalo Bill can keep out of the hands of the
Indians here until after to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For an instant it looked as if the baron meant to
flounce out behind him and fight a way through the
Indians there, but the heavy door banged in his face
and he clattered backward, almost falling to the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ach!” he gasped. “Vat a mans! Unt Puffalo Pill
is dis town py! Der baron ain’d dead yid! But der
golt is pooty much cobber, eh?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Outside, Conover had shaken off the Indians who
thronged about him, and took his way unmolested
thereafter into another part of the Indian town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither he nor Schnitzenhauser had heard rifle
shots and Indian yells far beyond the town; they were
too far off.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>BUFFALO BILL’S CAPTURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Red Feathers who had discovered and captured
the baron had also discovered the presence of
Buffalo Bill’s party, or had been informed by the
woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was not immediately manifest, however. Buffalo
Bill drew his party back from the mouth of the
mountain notch, intending to go into concealment until
by careful scouting he could learn something about
the Toltec town supposed to be in that hole in the
plain.</p>

<p class='c007'>By and by Buffalo Bill set out alone, intending to
steal along the base of the mountains which girt the
valley, hoping to come on something which would aid
him. He had two reasons now for wanting to get into
the town which he was sure existed. The child was
there, and so was the baron. Toltec Tom had so apparently
deserted him that he concluded not to trouble
about the fellow, unless fate threw the latter in
his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great scout had proceeded nearly a mile when
a sudden outburst of yells behind him, accompanied by
a cracking of rifles, told him that his friends had been
attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to backtrack at once, to assist them in
this emergency, when he discovered that some Red
Feathers had got in between himself and the camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly he found himself between hills, on the
edge of a cañon, with no way of crossing but an Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>footbridge of ropes, a thatching of ropes and
reeds—a swaying, flimsy structure, hanging over the
cañon and reaching from side to side.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no time for hesitation, and Buffalo Bill
rushed upon the swaying bridge, in an effort to cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the middle of it he halted and drew his revolvers.
By apparent intention, he had been driven
upon that bridge by the Indians who had chased him,
that he might be corralled, for other Indians now appeared
in the path on the other side of the cañon,
closing in on him there, as the others were closing in
on him from the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>On each side Indians dashed to the ends of the
bridge and began to hack at the ropes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill was trapped, and death by bullets or arrows,
or by a drop into the cañon, seemed to await
him, for even though he slew the foremost of his foes
he could not escape the other Red Feathers hurrying
to their aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, he stood defiantly on the swaying
structure as the Indians hacked at the ropes which held
it at the ends. His threatening revolvers kept the Red
Feathers from rushing out upon him, yet it was soon
apparent that they desired to have him as a prisoner,
rather than drop him into the cañon or riddle him with
their gold-headed arrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of them, apparently a chief, put up his hand,
shouted something that stopped the work of cutting
the ropes, and stepped to the end of the bridge at the
farther side. Buffalo Bill did not know it, but the
chief was old Fire Top.</p>

<p class='c007'>What the feathered chief said Buffalo Bill did not
comprehend, beyond the fact that his gestures told he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>wanted the white man to surrender; the language was
one the great white scout had never heard, though he
was familiar with many Indian dialects.</p>

<p class='c007'>He threw his revolvers down on the bridge, and followed
them with his hunting knife. It was suicidal
to do anything else. The Red Feathers had him at
their mercy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he held up his empty hands, palms outward,
in token of peace and submission.</p>

<p class='c007'>A yell of triumph burst from the throats of the
bedizened Indians, and the chief who had spoken
stepped out on the bridge to secure the discarded
weapons, while his warriors on the shores set arrows
to their bows and stood ready to slay the white man
if he showed treachery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old Fire Top was a glittering fellow, shining with
ornaments of gold and silver, and with a breastplate of
gold which nearly covered his bosom and glittered
brightly in the sun. It was native gold, fashioned
rudely by Indian hammers; in its center shone that
rayed image of the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gold must be cheap as clay round these parts,”
was the scout’s reflection. “I wonder where they got
it all. It’s a good thing for them that the white men
over yonder at Skyline don’t know about it, and it
stands them in hand to keep the secret close.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a thought which caused him to realize how
great was his peril. Only by killing the white men
who fell into their hands, and covering these mountains
with a pall of terror, could the Red Feathers
keep from the outer world all knowledge of the wonderful
stores of gold which it seemed they undoubtedly
possessed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>The chief threw the revolvers and knives to the
shore, then produced a thin rawhide rope, unwinding
it from about his own body, where it had been concealed
by the gold-ornamented panther skin which he
wore round his shoulders and waist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without a word the scout submitted to having his
hands tied and a length of the rawhide rope passed
loosely round his ankles. The end of this rope the
chief retained in his hand, so that if the prisoner tried
to run he could jerk it and trip him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief motioned, and Buffalo Bill walked on
across the bridge, followed by the Indians who had
chased him, and was surrounded at once by those on
the other side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Closing round him and the chief, the warriors
formed a guard and conducted him hurriedly along
the narrow mountain path until they came to a series
of steps cut in the stone and leading from the top of
the precipice down into the hole which held the Toltec
town.</p>

<p class='c007'>While descending these steps, which he saw could
be readily guarded by a few men, Buffalo Bill had a
good view of the town lying in the bottom of the deep
cavity, the hole, as has been said, being above a mile
in diameter in its widest part.</p>

<p class='c007'>The houses were flat-roofed, and most of them
seemed to be communal, indicating a large population.
The streets were winding and narrow. But near the
heart of the town the thoroughfares were wider, and
a large, circular street was there, inclosing a low dome-shaped
building whose roof flashed in the sun as if it
were of beaten gold. Close by it, seeming a part of
it, were other buildings that were smaller.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Near that dome-shaped structure rose what at first
the scout took to be the smoke of a large fire, but
when he was lower down on the long flight of steps
he saw that a pool of some kind lay there, sending
up steam, and he recalled the mud pots he had seen
hissing and bubbling by the way he had come from
Skyline.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw, also, as he got still farther down with his
captors, that the houses were of stone, a grayish-white
marble apparently, and that they were richly ornamented
with gold, or with something which glittered
like that metal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stone stairway led to the circular street before
the domed house, and there a great concourse of red-feathered
Indians, whose armlets, leg bands, and other
ornaments flashed in the sun.</p>

<p class='c007'>In their midst, standing as on a pedestal, he beheld
a white woman, clothed in white, fringed deerskins,
with a circlet of gold on her abundant black hair, and
behind her, his face pale and his manner nervous, stood
Tom Conover, staring at the captive scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The traitor!” was the scout’s indignant thought,
as he flashed Conover a look of high scorn. “This is
worse than that affair of the Niobrara.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A way opened before him between ranks of Indians,
and Buffalo Bill was conducted through it into
a stone prison.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he was thrust in, and the door banged behind
him, a human form flung itself against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ach! Donnerwetter! Dis is awful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the baron.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>BUFFALO BILL HEARS THE TRUTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Buffalo Bill knew the worst. He and his friends
were condemned to death. They were crouched together
in the little prison, whose shining bars and
heavy door were too much for their combined strength.
Wild Bill and Nomad were there, as well as the baron
and the scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Piute and his Apaches, out scouting when the
attack of the Red Feathers was made on Wild Bill and
Nomad, had escaped, perhaps by running, and where
they were now, or whether living or dead, could not
be told.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though knowing now the worst, Buffalo Bill and his
friends were not cast down. Peril only seemed to
quicken the spirits of Wild Bill. While as for old
Nomad, he did not fear Indians, nor did he fear
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor was the baron as much alarmed as one might
have expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the middle of the afternoon Buffalo Bill was
taken from the prison and conducted to a room in
the dome-shaped building which has already been mentioned.
From its general appearance Buffalo Bill had
already decided that it was a temple, perhaps of sun
worshipers, and this seemed to be borne out by the
fact that over the wide portal through which he was
taken was a large, rayed image of the sun, in gold, resembling
the gold piece he had found in the trail.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had learned from the baron that the apparent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>gold seen everywhere so plentifully was not all what
it seemed—was badly debased with a big percentage
of copper, but this representation of the sun, like the
smaller one he had found, seemed to him to be pure
gold, and no doubt it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>When conducted into the room that was at one side
of the main entrance he found that it resembled a
small sanctuary, and this was further borne out by
the robed figure that stood at its farther end, close by
a fire which burned red on a brazier of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'>The robed figure had been feeding the fire, and an
aromatic smell arose, showing that herbs had been
burning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thing that astonished Buffalo Bill was that in
a glittering seat close by the robed figure sat Toltec
Tom. And when the robed figure turned to face the
scout on his entrance he beheld the face of a woman
of fifty years or more—a white woman surely—whose
years had not yet been able to obliterate the undoubted
beauty of her youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her robes were of white skin. The scout judged
them to be dressed deerskins, tanned to a snowy whiteness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her arms were bare, and on them were loops of
gold whose flattened sides showed the sun image. In
her ears were earrings—pendants—also showing that
representation of the sun, and the front of the shining
brazier showed the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his Indian guards crowding in behind him,
Buffalo Bill halted when he beheld Tom Conover and
the woman. He looked accusingly at Conover, and
saw the red flush deepen in Conover’s face and crimson in the scar on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The woman looked up from the fire and beckoned
to the scout, pushing out a footstool in front of her,
indicating that he was to sit on it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doorway closed, but the Indian guards were
on the inside, and they held their lances in readiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This seems queer to you, Cody!” said Conover,
trying vainly to smile. “But you’ll understand it better,
maybe, and then you’ll not think so hard of me,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman paid no heed to this, but kept her dark
eyes fixed on the face of the scout as he came slowly
forward and took the stool.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she sat down, leaning back into the arms of a
chair that was graced with a panther skin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are some things that it is unpleasant to try
to understand,” was Buffalo Bill’s comment, in response
to the words of Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'>The light of the fire reddened the white robes of the
woman and gave a ruddy tinge to the cheek she turned
toward it. She sat looking earnestly at the scout for
a moment without speaking, and when she spoke her
words were clipped and broken, showing that she had
difficulty in using the language.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very hard for me to say the Ainglish,” she
declared, “and I know not hardly why it should be
said, for all is fixed that you and your friends go not
out of this place, but it is for him to please,” she
nodded to Conover, “and he will tell you more things
than what it is in my power to tell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Conover half lifted himself with a sudden, eager impatience,
then dropped back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s this way, Cody,” he said: “she can’t handle
the language like we can, for, though she knew it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>when she was a child, and I’ve taken the trouble to
teach her what I could, it doesn’t come natural to
her. I asked her to have you come here, that I could
explain; for I don’t want you to think too hard about
what has happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the scout did not answer, Conover went on
hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It all goes back to a good many years ago, when
I was captured by these Indians, and would have been
killed, if she had not saved my life. I paid her for
that, later, by marrying her. I couldn’t get away,
and by and by I didn’t want to; I only wanted to stay
with her. As I shan’t be able to make you understand
that part of it, Cody, I’ll not try to; only I’ll
say this, there came a time when I would have died
for this woman, and that time ain’t past yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we had quarrels, in spite of the fact that I
loved her better than any other woman I’d ever seen,
and then, too, I got jealous of the chief here, old
Fire Top. We had a regular duel about her, me and
him, on horseback, with lances, and that’s how I got
this beauty mark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He tapped the scar significantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fight happened out in the hills beyond the
town, and he left me here for dead. When I came to
myself, I was a bit hazy mentally, and I cut out, without
trying to get back. I feared, too, that old Fire
Top would kill me, after what had happened. And
she had turned against me. So I fled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was a good while ago. I shan’t go into all
the details—it ain’t necessary. But I hit out for the
white man’s country, and though I knew there was
gold here aplenty, I never cared to come back to try
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>to get any of it, for what is gold if you have to pay
your life for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I roamed round after that, here, there, and everywhere,
and done all sorts of work, and the years
slipped past. I kept my own counsel. I still loved this
woman, and I knew if I spread round a report of the
gold in here adventurers would crowd in, and maybe
the Toltecs here would be annihilated and the woman
killed, and I didn’t want that to happen. I had come
to like a good many of these reds, and, as I said, I
loved the woman, though I wasn’t sure that I’d ever
see her again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A month or so ago I met one of the Red Feathers
near the town of Cochise—you know where that is—and
he told me the woman was dead. He lied to me,
as I know now, because he was afraid I’d try to come
back, and he didn’t want it. But I took his word
for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That knocked me out—I went all to pieces; and in
Cochise, and in Skyline, I simply went on a spree that
came nigh being my last. You know about that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you know how I chanced to set out with you
for this place. When you asked me what I knew about
these Toltecs, and put it up to me, it came to me that
here was a chance to do a bit of good, in return for
all the wrong I’ve done, and also to find out about how
the woman had died, and all that, maybe. I still
thought she was sure dead. And—I didn’t want any
more of that child-stealing business to go on. I’ll tell
you soon about that—all about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t intend to desert you—I meant to play true
blue, and when it happened I felt that it wasn’t really
desertion. She came to me in the camp, when all were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>asleep, and woke me up, and I thought it was her
spirit, or that I was dreaming, and I got up when she
motioned to me and walked out on the blanket she put
down, and then I got on the horse she had and come
here with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I was to die this minute, Cody, I couldn’t help
doing that!” He looked appealingly at the scout. “I
couldn’t help it, and maybe I didn’t want to help it,
and I ain’t even sorry now, for, you see, I have got
her again, and she isn’t dead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He put his hand to his throat as if a lump choked
him there. But the woman sat impassive, without
moving her face, on which the red light of the fire
flickered. To all seeming, she did not hear or understand
a word Conover was saying. Yet her bright,
dark eyes were fixed on the scout, as if she sought
to read the emotions displayed in his countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I can understand your feelings somewhat,”
said the scout to Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks for that,” said Conover, his face brightening;
“I was afraid you couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Morgan boy is here—still here?” the scout
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m coming to that,” said Conover. “As you’ve
heard, every twenty or thirty years a white child is
stolen by these Toltecs, or, rather, by their priest.
This woman was stolen that way, when she was a
child. She was brought up here, and became the
priestess of these Toltec sun worshipers; that’s what
she was stole for.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ve got some kind of legend, or teaching,
which directs that their priest must be white, or nearly
white. I suppose before there were any white people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>in the country they took a very white Indian. It
teaches, too, that one priest must be a boy, and the next
a girl, and so on, and that they must be stolen from
some place by the priest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s supposed that the Great Spirit picks out the
child that is to be taken. So when the priest or priestess
thinks his or her death isn’t far off, it becomes a
duty for him or her to go out and find the child that
is pointed out by the Great Spirit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His voice choked again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She—Itzlan—that’s her Indian name”—he nodded
to the woman—“thought her time was near, and, believing
with the Indians, she set out to find the
child, a boy this time, and she got this child of Morgan’s,
and set out to bring him here.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She will teach him how to be a priest of the Toltecs,
and so well that he will want to be that, and
never will go back to his people; that’s the way it
always is; she wouldn’t go back to the white people;
she is a Toltec through and through, believing everything
they do. And it will be that way by and by with
this Morgan kid—he will be in time the white priest of
these Toltecs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She thought I was dead. But when she had left
the child in the hills by the trail and slipped back to see
if she had been followed, and then saw me, with you,
she felt that she couldn’t go on again, unless I went
with her. That’s what she has told me. And so she
planned to get me out of the camp, and I’ve told you
how she did it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And,” he licked his dry lips nervously, “that’s how
it happened; and I reckon that’s about all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The child is to be kept here?” said Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“Yes, and be trained up for the high priest of the
Toltecs; Itzlan there will see to that. It’s laid on her
as a part of her religion to do that, and she’ll do it.
The Toltecs felt grieved when she came back with
the child, for it was the first they had heard that she
didn’t think she would live long. But she says now,
has said to me, that since I’ve come back she doesn’t
feel that way. It’s queer, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stared nervously at Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I want you to understand it, so you’ll know how
it was, and won’t think too hard about me. That Niobrara
matter was bad, and likely you’ll think this one
worse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of all, Buffalo Bill felt sorry for Conover;
he could read the mental suffering in his face, which
Conover had endured, and he understood the strength
of the temptation to which the man had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose we are not to be released?” said the
scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She says not,” Conover answered, turning his gaze
away. “I’ve tried to get her to change that, but I
can’t; it’s one thing she is set on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned again to the scout.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the way she looks at it, and the way old
Fire Top looks at it. He’s the chief, and the head of
the warriors, and in his way he has more power here
than she has. She’s the religious leader, you see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, she and Fire Top believe that the only way
to keep white men from coming here and driving out
the Toltecs is for the Toltecs to kill all that do come,
and so make others afraid to come. She says the
white men love gold so that if they knew what was
here they could not be kept back, so many of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>would come. But the white people won’t trouble
the place so long as they don’t know about the gold,
and are made afraid to come nigh it. I suppose she’s
right about that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His face was troubled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d do something if I could, Cody, and that’s a
fact, though you may not believe it. I’m afraid I
can’t do anything. I feel sorry about it, and feel a bit
responsible, as I set out as your guide to this spot. I
ought to have known better. But I meant well. Only
I didn’t know Itzlan was living, you see!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand,” said the scout. “We are to be
killed, at the order of this woman, so that knowledge
of this place may not get to the world outside.
But you may tell her, for me, that she is making a
mistake in that, for if I and my friends do not return
from this spot the United States government will
surely send here a force strong enough to annihilate
this whole tribe of Toltecs. I wish you’d make that
plain to her, Conover, if she doesn’t thoroughly understand
my words now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman’s face was still impassive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor did it change in its expression even when Tom
Conover began to translate to her in the Toltec language
the threatening statement which Buffalo Bill
had made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scout could see that the woman did not intend
to relent.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE HEART OF TOM CONOVER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The battle that raged in the heart of Tom Conover
after that interview with Buffalo Bill can be but dimly
indicated here.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the end the man’s better instincts triumphed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill and his friends did not at once know
this, however.</p>

<p class='c007'>Night came early in the town that lay in the deep
pit of the plain, the evening shadows deepening there
even before the sun had set on the world outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within the marble prison the darkness was soon so
dense that, as Wild Bill said, “it could be felt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No food had been brought to the prisoners, nor
had any messenger come to them, after that first announcement,
conveyed by the woman herself, that it
had been decided in council they were to die.</p>

<p class='c007'>They crouched in the gloom and talked as the slow
hours slipped by, while they waited, they did not know
for what.</p>

<p class='c007'>They tried the gold-copper bars of their prison again
and again, but the bars were too strong and well set;
they could not even shake them. They had no tools
with which to hack at the marble walls, and probably
if tools had been in their possession they could have
accomplished nothing in that way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ach!” grunted the baron, after a long interval of
silence. “Dose vite Inchin mans vass a liar peen, aber
he ton’d come unt hellup me, like as he said. Uff I
hat someding to ead, I vouldn’t veel so pat, maybe.
Here iss a town full of golt, and noddings to ead.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“There is enough to eat in the town, no doubt,” commented
Wild Bill, “but it’s like the gold—we can’t
get it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aber I hund vor golt eenymore I hobes somepoty
vill keeck me ka-vick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid you won’t hunt for gold any more,
baron! But what’s the use of being blue? Can’t we
do something—can’t we sing a little? I’ve got a voice
like a crow, but I’d join in, if somebody would raise
a tune.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to sing a popular air that had a lighthearted
lilt in it, and it was wonderful what a change
it made in their spirits. They began to talk more confidently,
and plan for a vigorous resistance when the
time came for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But later on their plans were altered.</p>

<p class='c007'>A door of their prison, of which they had not
known, opened behind them, and snapped shut with a
click, and they knew that some one had entered the
room. When the intruder spoke they discovered that
it was Tom Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve made up my mind to help you,” he said, speaking
in low tones. “You are to be slain at sunrise in
the morning, by one of the priests of the Toltec temple.
You saw the steaming lake that lies close by this
prison—right behind it, in fact. The temple and this
prison were built on this spot because of that boiling
lake. Victims are stabbed on the stone steps back
there, which lead down to it, and then their bodies
tumble down into the lake, and that is the end of them,
and people standing on the other shore, when they see
that the thing is done, set up a great shout and afterward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>there are religious exercises in the temple, led
by the priests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve seen it myself, more than once; all enemies
are served that way; and once a year, if no enemies
have been taken, warriors are selected by lot for the
purpose. It’s a horrible business, and I never was in
love with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that’s the plan for you. I didn’t see at first
how I could help it, as Itzlan is determined you shall
not leave here alive; but I’ve worked out a plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is one Indian here who used to be my servant,
and he will do whatever I tell him, perhaps because
he isn’t over-and-above bright. Well, I have
had him get your horses and tie them to those little
pines at the edge of the trail, where it comes down
from that notch in the mountains. You know the
place. And I have had him tie your rifles and weapons
to the saddles. On one of the saddles he has hung
two buckskin bags of gold—pure gold; and that is
for this Morgan boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I was a fool for doing that. But I’m
going to risk it. And risk the anger of the woman.
I’ll pull through all right, for the woman will stand
by me, whatever comes. And I reckon,” he added
thoughtfully, “that I’ll need her, if it gets out that I
did it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why can’t you go with us?” asked Buffalo Bill,
who had risen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other prisoners had also risen, in their excitement,
the German with a startling clatter of his
wooden shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’d better take those blocks off your feet,” advised
Conover, “they make too much noise; your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>stocking feet will be best for you. Carry the shoes in
your hand, if you must have them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ach!” panted the baron, “der desert sand voult
purn my feed off mitoudt ’em!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then carry them in your hands. And now listen:
Whatever the risk is, I’m going to take it. This door
I came through here is a secret one, and only a few
even of the Toltecs know of it. I’m going to hope
that suspicion will fall on some of those who do know.
For I think it isn’t understood that I possess the secret.
Itzlan told me about it long ago, but perhaps she even
has forgot that she did. Anyway, I take the risk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen: You are to follow me quietly out of this
place and down the stone steps—the steps of sacrifice.
There is a little path which we can take past the boiling
lake, and we can get out of town by it, for, besides
the lake, there are only a few houses, as the steam
makes it unpleasant for people to live there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we can get out of the town, as the night
is dark, and the steam, which is bad to-night, makes
the air even thicker.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He had dropped, or forgotten, nearly all of his dialect,
his words showing now, in his haste and excitement,
that once, at any rate, he had been a man of
some education and attainments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you reach the horses you will find the child
there, tied up by the bushes. My Indian friend has
stolen him and placed him there, and I had him give
the kid a sleeping drink to keep him from making any
noise. It sounds cruel, but it seemed necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’m wasting too much time. No,” he said,
as Wild Bill sought to take him by the hand, “I don’t
feel worthy to touch the hand of any honest and upright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>white man. You know why. But perhaps I
can right things this way, and I want to, and I’ll take
the risk. It will not be so great, and Itzlan will stand
by me and protect me, no matter what comes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They heard him turn about.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Follow me,” he whispered. “And take your shoes
off, Schnitzenhauser. It wouldn’t be a bad idea if all
of you removed your shoes. We’ve got to be silent
as death itself, for if these Toltecs woke up to what’s
happening, not one of us would live ten minutes.
There’s a guard in front of the prison, but none out
by that boiling lake. Even those guards are ignorant
of this secret door. Now, follow me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They heard him fumbling along the wall and were
sure he was searching for the hidden spring which
moved the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The horses were left out on the plain, for pasturage,”
he said, as if this were an afterthought, “so
that my Indian had no trouble in placing them where
I told him to. The worst trouble was with the child.
I had to steal the kid out from under the nose of one
of the temple priests, and give him into the hands of
the Indian. That was as hard a thing to do as anything
that is before us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hidden spring clicked under his fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scout and his companions were anxious to interrupt,
to tell him how grateful they were, and beg his
pardon for any wrong they had done by misjudging
him, but his manner and the tones of his voice, as
well as his direct warnings, kept them silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>They heard the secret door spring open almost
noiselessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Follow me!” Conover repeated. “And step carefully.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>There is a flight of stone steps here. Just
follow my voice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stepped aside, waiting until they had filed silently
out of the marble prison; then they heard the snap of
the spring of the secret door, as it moved back into
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that he put himself at their head, and, by
whispering to them, directed them where and how to
step in order to follow him safely.</p>

<p class='c007'>They felt the warm mist of the boiling lake on their
faces and in their nostrils as they descended the flight
of steps toward it, and puffs of hot steam were blown
in their faces as they followed Conover in the darkness
along the narrow path skirting the lake. Below
they could hear its bubbling, like the sputtering of
some giant teakettle.</p>

<p class='c007'>It took iron nerves to repress a shudder as they
passed along the lake and thought of the fate that
had been fixed for them by Itzlan and the priests of the
Toltec temple.</p>

<p class='c007'>A half hour or more was consumed in getting out
of the town, for a long flight of stone steps had to be
ascended, but they reached the upland finally, with
Conover still leading the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>There he stopped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-by!” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>The moon had not yet risen—it rose late, toward
morning; but in the starlight they could see him, and
could discern that he held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I feel that I can shake hands with you now,” he
said. “I think that you will get away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come with us!” Buffalo Bill urged, as he shook
heartily the hand given him by Conover.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>“No!” said Conover, with a positive click of his
teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gravely he shook hands with all of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” he repeated. “I’ve got to stay here! In the
first place, since Itzlan is still alive, I don’t want to
go. In the second place, if she gets into trouble I
want to be here to help her. But I think there will
be no trouble for either of us. She has a lot of influence,
and many friends. It would mean war if any
of the priests or chiefs turned against her. So there
will be no trouble. I’m even hoping that neither of
us will even be suspected of this thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He pointed to the starlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Off there is the notch, and your horses, and the
Morgan kid; you’ll find them all now without trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t come with us?” said the great scout,
reluctant to leave him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! And I’m hoping that none of you will ever
come this way again. We’ll not meet any more, likely.
So, good-by, and success to you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He turned, as he said this, and broke into a run, as
if he feared to linger; and the darkness soon hid him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buffalo Bill turned about and headed toward the
notch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forward march!” he said. “We want to be well
out of this before morning comes. The Red Feathers
will be hot after us as soon as they can see to strike
the trail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They found the horses, and the child, their arms
and ammunition, and the two stuffed bags of gold for
the Morgan boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in the darkness they rode away, wondering at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>their strange escape, and questioning among themselves
as to what had become of the Piute and the
Apaches.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when morning dawned they came on the four
Indians, who, hiding beside the trail, had been trying
to screw up courage enough to make a scouting trip
in the direction of the valley.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ai, Pa-e-has-ka!” they shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>They fell in joyfully behind the party of white men,
and the flight was resumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a running flight, kept up without regard for
the comfort of man or beast, until they knew they were
well beyond the reach of the Toltecs, whose pursuit
they feared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two days later they placed the boy in the home of
his parents, with the bags of gold which Tom Conover
had given him.</p>

<p class='c007'>And their journey to and from the terrible Cumbres
was at an end.</p>
